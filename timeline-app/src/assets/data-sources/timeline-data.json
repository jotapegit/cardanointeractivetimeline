Their widespread deployment has allowed the growth of important applications, such as, internet banking and e-commerce. Centralized PKIs (CPKIs) rely on a hierarchy of trusted Certification Authorities (CAs) for issuing, distributing and managing the status of digital certificates, i.e., unforgeable data structures that attest to the authenticity of an entity's public key. Unfortunately, CPKIs have many downsides in terms of security and fault tolerance and there have been numerous security incidents throughout the years. Decentralized PKIs (DPKIs) were proposed to deal with these issues as they rely on multiple, independent nodes. Nevertheless, decentralization raises other concerns such as what are the incentives for the participating nodes to ensure the service's availability.","In our work, we leverage the scalability, as well as, the built-in incentive mechanism of blockchain systems and propose a smart contract-based DPKI. The main barrier in realizing a smart contract-based DPKI is the size of the contract's state which, being its most expensive resource to access, should be minimized for a construction to be viable. We resolve this problem by proposing and using in our DPKI a public-state cryptographic accumulator with constant size, a cryptographic tool which may be of independent interest in the context of blockchain protocols. We also are the first to formalize the DPKI design problem in the Universal Composability (UC) framework and formally prove the security of our construction under the strong RSA assumption in the Random Oracle model and the existence of an ideal smart contract functionality."],"paperURL":"https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/853.pdf","dateUnix":1509490800,"dateEU":"01.11.2017","position":"50perc

without trusted intermediaries has a long history that dates back to modern cryptography’s infancy. Two main challenges towards bringing it into real-life are enforcing the distribution of the rewards, and penalizing misbehaving/aborting parties. Using recent advances on cryptocurrencies and blockchain technologies, Andrychowicz et al. (IEEE S&P 2014 and FC 2014 BITCOIN Workshop) were able to address those problems. Improving on these results, Kumaresan et al. (CCS 2015) and Bentov et al. (ASIACRYPT 2017) proposed specific purpose poker protocols that made significant progress towards meeting the real-world deployment requirements. However, their protocols still lack either efficiency or a formal security proof in a strong model. Specifically, the work of Kumaresan et al. relies on Bitcoin and simple contracts, but is not very efficient as it needs numerous interactions with the cryptocurrency network as well as a lot of collateral. Bentov et al. achieve further improvements by using stateful contracts and off-chain execution: they show a solution based on general multiparty computation that has a security proof in a strong model, but is also not very efficient. Alternatively, it proposes to use tailor-made poker protocols as a building block to improve the efficiency. However, a security proof is unfortunately still missing for the latter case: the security properties the tailor-made protocol would need to meet were not even specified, let alone proven to be met by a given protocol. Our solution closes this undesirable gap as it concurrently: (1) enforces the rewards’ distribution; (2) enforces penalties on misbehaving parties; (3) has efficiency comparable to the tailor-made protocols; (4) has a security proof in a simulation-based model of security. Combining techniques from the above works, from tailor-made poker protocols and from efficient zero-knowledge proofs for shuffles, and performing optimizations, we obtain a solution that satisfies all four desired criteria and does not incur a big burden on the blockchain."],"paperURL":"https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/899.pdf","dateUnix":1519858800,"dateEU":"01.03.2018","position":"30perc","showTitle":true},"width":null}],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null,"position":"30perc","singleContain":"paper"},{"dateEU":"02.03.2018","dateUnix":1519948800,"priceUSD":0.2998,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"03.03.2018","dateUnix":1520035200,"priceUSD":0.2914,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"04.03.2018","dateUnix":1520121600,"priceUSD":0.2897,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"05.03.2018","dateUnix":1520208000,"priceUSD":0.2961,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"06.03.2018","dateUnix":1520294400,"priceUSD":0.2952,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"07.03.2018","dateUnix":1520380800,"priceUSD":0.2783,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"08.03.2018","dateUnix":1520467200,"priceUSD":0.2446,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"09.03.2018","dateUnix":1520553600,"priceUSD":0.2157,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"10.03.2018","dateUnix":1520640000,"priceUSD":0.2112,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"11.03.2018","dateUnix":1520726400,"priceUSD":0.205,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"12.03.2018","dateUnix":1520812800,"priceUSD":0.22,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"13.03.2018","dateUnix":1520899200,"priceUSD":0.2245,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"14.03.2018","dateUnix":1520985600,"priceUSD":0.2216,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"15.03.2018","dateUnix":1521072000,"priceUSD":0.2003,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"16.03.2018","dateUnix":1521158400,"priceUSD":0.1873,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"17.03.2018","dateUnix":1521244800,"priceUSD":0.1821,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"18.03.2018","dateUnix":1521331200,"priceUSD":0.158,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"19.03.2018","dateUnix":1521417600,"priceUSD":0.1561,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"20.03.2018","dateUnix":1521504000,"priceUSD":0.1946,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"21.03.2018","dateUnix":1521590400,"priceUSD":0.2038,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"22.03.2018","dateUnix":1521676800,"priceUSD":0.2159,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"23.03.2018","dateUnix":1521763200,"priceUSD":0.2038,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"24.03.2018","dateUnix":1521849600,"priceUSD":0.1893,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"25.03.2018","dateUnix":1521936000,"priceUSD":0.1891,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"26.03.2018","dateUnix":1522022400,"priceUSD":0.1849,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"27.03.2018","dateUnix":1522108800,"priceUSD":0.1678,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"28.03.2018","dateUnix":1522195200,"priceUSD":0.1557,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"29.03.2018","dateUnix":1522281600,"priceUSD":0.1599,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"30.03.2018","dateUnix":1522368000,"priceUSD":0.1463,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"31.03.2018","dateUnix":1522454400,"priceUSD":0.1467,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"01.04.2018","dateUnix":1522540800,"priceUSD":0.1555,"markers":[{"showTitle":false,"category":"paper","type":"dot","style":null,"position":null,"data":{"paperID":172,"title":"Ouroboros Praos: An adaptively-secure, semi-synchronous proof-of-stake protocol","url":"https://iohk.io/en/research/library/papers/ouroboros-praos-an-adaptively-secure-semi-synchronous-proof-of-stake-protocol/","authors":["Bernardo David,","Peter Gaži,","Prof Aggelos Kiayias,","Prof Alexander Russell"],"tags":["consensus","cryptocurrency","proof of stake"],"date":"April 2018","location":"EUROCRYPT 2018","desc":["We present “Ouroboros Praos”, a proof-of-stake blockchain protocol that, for the first time, provides security against fully-adaptive corruption in the semi-synchronous setting: Specifically, the adversary can corrupt any participant of a dynamically evolving population of stakeholders at any moment as long the stakeholder distribution maintains an honest majority of stake; furthermore, the protocol tolerates an adversarially-controlled message delivery delay unknown to protocol participants.","To achieve these guarantees we formalize and realize in the universal composition setting a suitable form of forward secure digital signatures and a new type of verifiable random function that maintains unpredictability under malicious key generation.

In a nutshell, these works conclude that Bitcoin is secure if and only if the majority of the mining power is honest. Despite their great impact, however, these works do not address an incisive question asked by positivists and Bitcoin critics, which is fuelled by the fact that Bitcoin indeed works in reality: Why should the real-world system adhere to these assumptions?","In this work we employ the machinery from the Rational Protocol Design (RPD) framework by Garay et al.

We show assuming a natural class of incentives for the miners’ behavior—i.e., rewarding them for adding blocks to the blockchain but having them pay for mining—where one can reserve the honest majority assumption as a fallback, or even, depending on the application, completely replace it by the assumption that the miners aim to maximize their revenue.","Our results underscore the appropriateness of RPD as a “rational cryptography” framework for analyzing Bitcoin.

In contrast, Bitcoin blockchain will be insecure if the adversary controls more than 50% of mining power.","Our design follows a recent provably secure proof-of-work/proof-of-stake hybrid blockchain by Duong et al. (ePrint 2016). In order to make our construction practical, we enhance Duong et al.’s design. In particular, we introduce a new strategy for difficulty adjustment in the hybrid blockchain and provide an analysis of it. We also show how to construct a light client for proof-of-stake cryptocurrencies and evaluate the proposal practically.","We implement our new design. Our implementation uses a recent modular development framework for blockchains, called Scorex. It allows us to change only certain parts of an application leaving other codebase intact. In addition to the blockchain implementation, a testnet is deployed.

The attack grows in power with the number of honest transactions and the stake held by the adversary, and can be launched by an adversary controlling any constant fraction of the stake.","With the present statistical profile of blockchain protocols, the attack can be launched given a few years of prior blockchain operation; hence it is within the realm of feasibility for PoS protocols. Most importantly, it demonstrates how closely transaction fees and rewards are coupled with the security properties of PoS protocols. More broadly, our attack must be reflected and countered in any future PoS design that avoids checkpointing, as well as any effort to remove checkpointing from existing protocols.

An essential element of such systems is a routing protocol able to quickly restructure existing routes when nodes leave and provide routes to new nodes. In most MANET routing protocols, nodes are assumed to be altruistic, that is, forward incoming packets to the next node in the route. However, as pointed out in a number of previous works, nodes are often selfish in real world scenarios, refusing to forward incoming packets from their peers but still using the MANET to route their own packets. In this work, we propose MARS, a blockchain-based reputation system that acts as an overlay on top of existing MANET routing protocols (e.g. AODV and OLSR). The main goal of MARS is to keep a publicly available (and verifiable) record of node behavior that can be used to both select good routes and incentivize nodes to actively participate in routing to earn rewards. As a building block, we propose a compact “proof-of-routing” that allows a node to prove that it has participated in the rout- ing of a batch of packets. Upon presenting such a proof, the node earns a reputation point, which is stored as an asset in the blockchain, and as such can be traded for enhanced network services among MANET nodes or for other assets (e.g. cryptocurrencies) with third parties."],"paperURL":"http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/3211933.3211948","dateUnix":1527804000,"dateEU":"01.06.2018"},"width":null}],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"02.06.2018","dateUnix":1527897600,"priceUSD":0.222,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"03.06.2018","dateUnix":1527984000,"priceUSD":0.2266,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"04.06.2018","dateUnix":1528070400,"priceUSD":0.2264,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"05.06.2018","dateUnix":1528156800,"priceUSD":0.2137,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"06.06.2018","dateUnix":1528243200,"priceUSD":0.2193,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"07.06.2018","dateUnix":1528329600,"priceUSD":0.2152,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"08.06.2018","dateUnix":1528416000,"priceUSD":0.2092,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"09.06.2018","dateUnix":1528502400,"priceUSD":0.2043,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"10.06.2018","dateUnix":1528588800,"priceUSD":0.2001,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"11.06.2018","dateUnix":1528675200,"priceUSD":0.177,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"12.06.2018","dateUnix":1528761600,"priceUSD":0.181,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"13.06.2018","dateUnix":1528848000,"priceUSD":0.1662,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"14.06.2018","dateUnix":1528934400,"priceUSD":0.1606,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"15.06.2018","dateUnix":1529020800,"priceUSD":0.1717,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"16.06.2018","dateUnix":1529107200,"priceUSD":0.1622,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"17.06.2018","dateUnix":1529193600,"priceUSD":0.1624,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"18.06.2018","dateUnix":1529280000,"priceUSD":0.1602,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"19.06.2018","dateUnix":1529366400,"priceUSD":0.1635,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"20.06.2018","dateUnix":1529452800,"priceUSD":0.1666,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"21.06.2018","dateUnix":1529539200,"priceUSD":0.1617,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"22.06.2018","dateUnix":1529625600,"priceUSD":0.1583,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"23.06.2018","dateUnix":1529712000,"priceUSD":0.1405,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"24.06.2018","dateUnix":1529798400,"priceUSD":0.1388,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"25.06.2018","dateUnix":1529884800,"priceUSD":0.1321,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"26.06.2018","dateUnix":1529971200,"priceUSD":0.1352,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"27.06.2018","dateUnix":1530057600,"priceUSD":0.1261,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"28.06.2018","dateUnix":1530144000,"priceUSD":0.127,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"29.06.2018","dateUnix":1530230400,"priceUSD":0.1195,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"30.06.2018","dateUnix":1530316800,"priceUSD":0.1251,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"01.07.2018","dateUnix":1530403200,"priceUSD":0.1378,"markers":[{"showTitle":false,"category":"paper","type":"dot","style":null,"position":null,"data":{"paperID":165,"title":"Formal specification for a Cardano wallet","url":"https://iohk.io/en/research/library/papers/formal-specification-for-a-cardano-wallet/","authors":["Duncan Coutts,","Edsko de Vries"],"tags":["implementation","proof of stake"],"date":"July 2018","location":"IOHK","desc":["This document is a formal specification of a wallet for Cardano (or any UTxO-based cryptocurrency).

To address this we propose a new PoS-based protocol, “Ouroboros Genesis”, that adapts one of the latest cryptographically-secure PoS-based blockchain protocols with a novel chain selection rule. The rule enables new or offline parties to safely (re-)join and bootstrap their blockchain from the genesis block without any trusted advice—such as checkpoints—or assumptions regarding past availability.

We consider security properties of decentralized blockchain-based consensus protocols. The object of research is block confirmation time for users to get assurance that their transaction will not be reverted.","Objective. The goal of the paper is to analyze double-spend attacks on the different blockchain-based systems and compare resulting probabilities of attacker's success.","Method. We presented two models for two types of attacks on the Ouroboros protocol (for the general and covert adversaries). The models allow calculating the exact number of slots needed to achieve the required level of security. It was shown that the Ouroboros protocol allows achieving the required security level with significantly shorter confirmation period in comparison with Bitcoin. We estimated minimal number of confirmation blocks and compare estimation time for Bitcoin, GHOST and Ouroboros protocols. As a measure of comparison, we considered transaction confirmation time for which the probability of a double-spend attack is less than 0.1%. We use different standard probability distribution and different properties of Markov chains and Random Walks to get comparison of estimated security properties of Bitcoin blockchain against three different models of Bitcoin double spend attack. The splitting attack based on the model where resources of honest participants are divided to compete different chains is applied to Bitcoin and GHOST consensus protocols. Properties of Markov chains and Random Walks are also applied to obtain security estimations for the Ouroboros protocol.","Results. We developed methods to get specific numbers for average block confirmation time for Ouroboros protocol.

Yet the utility of complex FMI comprising long custodial chains and large global Central Counterparties (CCPs) for the operation of modern markets is not seriously disputed. The change in the technology paradigm with the introduction of DLT systems for securities and derivatives FMI can increase investor control, the efficiency of risk management and, to some extent, augment the distribution of systemic risk. It can thus create a more diverse and resilient financial ecosystem. This cross-disciplinary paper identifies a multitude of reasons that favour a paradigm shift in FMI technology. It also sketches a comprehensive blockchain-based framework for the development of permission-based platforms for derivatives clearing and settlement and the handling of liquidity shortages within DLT systems. Arguably, the impact of technological change should lead to a reduction of industry rents for the benefit of end investors and of the end users of finance (entrepreneurs and businesses) enhancing market welfare.

We both tackle the problem of constructing protocols for general card games and initiate a treatment of such protocols in the Universal Composability (UC) framework, introducing an ideal functionality that captures general card games constructed from a set of core card operations. Based on this formalism, we introduce Royale, the first universally composable protocol for securely playing general card games with financial rewards/penalties enforcement.

Nevertheless, each of these coins functions in a stand-alone manner, independently. Sidechains have been envisioned as a mechanism to allow blockchains to communicate with one another and, among other applications, allow the transfer of value from one chain to another, but so far there have been no decentralized constructions. In this paper, we put forth the first sidechains construction that allows communication between proof-of-work blockchains without trusted intermediaries. Our construction is generic in that it allows the passing of any information between blockchains. It gives rise to two illustrative examples: the “remote ICO,” in which an investor pays in currency on one blockchain to receive tokens in another, and the “two-way peg,” in which an asset can be transferred from one chain to another and back. We pinpoint the features needed for two chains to communicate: On the source side, a proof-of-work blockchain that has been interlinked, potentially with a velvet fork; on the destination side, a blockchain with any consensus mechanism that has sufficient expressibility to implement verification. We model our construction mathematically and give a formal proof of security. In the heart of our construction, we use a recently introduced cryptographic primitive, Non-Interactive Proofs of Proof-of-Work (NIPoPoWs). Our security proof uses a standard cryptographic reduction from our new proof-of-work sidechains protocol to the security of NIPoPoWs, which has, in turn, been shown to be secure in previous work. Our working assumption is honest majority in each of the communicating chains.

The industry's response to securing the user's assets is to offer tamper-resistant hardware wallets. Although such wallets are considered to be the most secure means for managing an account, no formal attempt has been previously done to identify, model and formally verify their properties. This paper provides the first formal model of the Bitcoin hardware wallet operations. We identify the properties and security parameters of a Bitcoin wallet and formally define them in the Universal Composition (UC) Framework. We present a modular treatment of a hardware wallet ecosystem, by realizing the wallet functionality in a hybrid setting defined by a set of protocols. This approach allows us to capture in detail the wallet's components, their interaction and the potential threats.

systems, in particular cryptocurrencies, face a serious limitation: scalability. This holds, especially, in terms of number of transactions per second. Several alternatives are currently being pursued by both the research and practitioner communities. One venue for exploration is on protocols that do not constantly add transactions on the blockchain and therefore do not consume the blockchain’s resources. This is done using off-chain transactions, i.e., protocols that minimize the interaction with the blockchain, also commonly known as Layer-2 approaches. This work relates several existing off-chain channel methods, also known as payment and state channels, channel network constructions methods, and other components as channel and network management protocols, e.g., routing nodes. All these components are crucial to keep the usability of the channel, and are often overlooked. For the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to propose a taxonomy for all the components of the Layer-2. We provide an extensive coverage on the state-of-art protocols available.

Their aim is immutability: once a block has been added to the chain it should not be altered or removed. The seminal blockchain, Bitcoin, uses a graph-based model that is purely functional in nature. But Bitcoin has limited support for smart contracts and distributed applications. The seminal smart-contract platform, Ethereum, uses an imperative and object-oriented model of accounts. Ethereum has been subject to numerous exploits, often linked to its use of shared mutable state by way of its imperative and object-oriented features in a concurrent and distributed system. Coding a distributed application for Ethereum requires two languages: Javascript to run off-chain, which submits transaction written in Solidity to run on-chain.","This paper describes Plutus Platform, a functional blockchain smart contract system for coding distributed applications on top of the Cardano blockchain. Most blockchain programming platforms depend on a custom language, such as Ethereum’s Solidity, but Plutus is provided as a set of libraries for Haskell. Both off-chain and on-chain code are written in Haskell: off-chain code using the Plutus library, and on-chain code in a subset of Haskell using Template Haskell. On-chain code is compiled to a tiny functional language called Plutus Core, which is System Fω with iso-recursive types and suitable primitives.","Plutus and Cardano are available open source, and Plutus Playground provides a web-based IDE that enables users to try out the system and to develop simple applications."],"paperURL":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/478201/items/MK4NWDIF/file/view?key=PnpP8O1NApZMMF0LVNh7I4I5","dateUnix":1556661600,"dateEU":"01.05.2019"},"width":null},{"showTitle":false,"category":"paper","type":"dot","style":null,"position":null,"data":{"paperID":148,"title":"Cryptocurrency Egalitarianism: A Quantitative Approach","url":"https://iohk.io/en/research/library/papers/cryptocurrency-egalitarianism-a-quantitative-approach/","authors":["Dimitris Karakostas,","Prof Aggelos Kiayias,","Christos Nasikas,","Dionysis Zindros"],"tags":["cryptocurrency"],"date":"May 2019","location":"Tokenomics 2019","desc":["Since the invention of Bitcoin one decade ago, numerous cryptocurrencies have sprung into existence. Among these, proof-of-work is the most common mechanism for achieving consensus, whilst a number of coins have adopted \"ASIC-resistance\" as a desirable property, claiming to be more \"egalitarian\", where egalitarianism refers to the power of each coin to participate in the creation of new coins. While proof-of-work consensus dominates the space, several new cryptocurrencies employ alternative consensus, such as proof-of-stake in which block minting opportunities are based on monetary ownership. A core criticism of proof-of-stake revolves around it being less egalitarian by making the rich richer, as opposed to proof-of-work in which everyone can contribute equally according to their computational power. In this paper, we give the first quantitative definition of a cryptocurrency's egalitarianism. Based on our definition, we measure the egalitarianism of popular cryptocurrencies that (may or may not) employ ASIC-resistance, among them Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and Monero. Our simulations show, as expected, that ASIC-resistance increases a cryptocurrency's egalitarianism. We also measure the egalitarianism of a stake-based protocol, Ouroboros, and a hybrid proof-of-stake/proof-of-work cryptocurrency, Decred.

If additionally a block satisfies H(B) ≤ T2−µ, it is called a µ-superblock. Superblocks play an important role in the construction of compact blockchain proofs which allows the compression of PoW blockchains into so-called Non-Interactive Proofs of Proof-ofWork (NIPoPoWs). These certificates are essential for the construction of superlight clients, which are blockchain wallets that can synchronize exponentially faster than traditional SPV clients.","In this work, we measure the distribution of superblocks in the Bitcoin blockchain. We find that the superblock distribution within the blockchain follows expectation, hence we empirically verify that the distribution of superblocks within the Bitcoin blockchain has not been adversarially biased. NIPoPoWs require that each block in a blockchain points to a sample of previous blocks in the blockchain. These pointers form a data structure called the interlink. We give efficient ways to store the interlink data structure. Repeated superblock references within an interlink can be omitted with no harm to security. Hence, it is more efficient to store a set of superblocks rather than a list. We show that, in honest executions, this simple observation reduces the number of superblock references by approximately a half in expectation. We then verify our theoretical result by measuring the improvement over existing blockchains in terms of the interlink sizes (which we improve by 79%) and the sizes of succinct NIPoPoWs (which we improve by 25%). As such, we show that deduplication allows superlight clients to synchronize 25% faster."],"paperURL":"https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/1444.pdf","dateUnix":1556661600,"dateEU":"01.05.2019"},"width":null}],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"02.05.2019","dateUnix":1556755200,"priceUSD":0.0684,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"03.05.2019","dateUnix":1556841600,"priceUSD":0.068,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"04.05.2019","dateUnix":1556928000,"priceUSD":0.0694,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"05.05.2019","dateUnix":1557014400,"priceUSD":0.0666,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"06.05.2019","dateUnix":1557100800,"priceUSD":0.0657,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"07.05.2019","dateUnix":1557187200,"priceUSD":0.0665,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"08.05.2019","dateUnix":1557273600,"priceUSD":0.0639,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"09.05.2019","dateUnix":1557360000,"priceUSD":0.0642,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"10.05.2019","dateUnix":1557446400,"priceUSD":0.0617,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"11.05.2019","dateUnix":1557532800,"priceUSD":0.0632,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"12.05.2019","dateUnix":1557619200,"priceUSD":0.0766,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"13.05.2019","dateUnix":1557705600,"priceUSD":0.07,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"14.05.2019","dateUnix":1557792000,"priceUSD":0.0729,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"15.05.2019","dateUnix":1557878400,"priceUSD":0.0843,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"16.05.2019","dateUnix":1557964800,"priceUSD":0.0949,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"17.05.2019","dateUnix":1558051200,"priceUSD":0.0882,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"18.05.2019","dateUnix":1558137600,"priceUSD":0.0832,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"19.05.2019","dateUnix":1558224000,"priceUSD":0.0793,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"20.05.2019","dateUnix":1558310400,"priceUSD":0.0867,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"21.05.2019","dateUnix":1558396800,"priceUSD":0.0848,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"22.05.2019","dateUnix":1558483200,"priceUSD":0.0845,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"23.05.2019","dateUnix":1558569600,"priceUSD":0.0781,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"24.05.2019","dateUnix":1558656000,"priceUSD":0.0801,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"25.05.2019","dateUnix":1558742400,"priceUSD":0.0805,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"26.05.2019","dateUnix":1558828800,"priceUSD":0.0802,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"27.05.2019","dateUnix":1558915200,"priceUSD":0.0857,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"28.05.2019","dateUnix":1559001600,"priceUSD":0.0919,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"29.05.2019","dateUnix":1559088000,"priceUSD":0.0929,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"30.05.2019","dateUnix":1559174400,"priceUSD":0.0909,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"31.05.2019","dateUnix":1559260800,"priceUSD":0.0849,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"01.06.2019","dateUnix":1559347200,"priceUSD":0.0898,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"02.06.2019","dateUnix":1559433600,"priceUSD":0.0907,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"03.06.2019","dateUnix":1559520000,"priceUSD":0.0964,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"04.06.2019","dateUnix":1559606400,"priceUSD":0.0888,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"05.06.2019","dateUnix":1559692800,"priceUSD":0.0824,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"06.06.2019","dateUnix":1559779200,"priceUSD":0.0832,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"07.06.2019","dateUnix":1559865600,"priceUSD":0.0839,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"08.06.2019","dateUnix":1559952000,"priceUSD":0.0858,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"09.06.2019","dateUnix":1560038400,"priceUSD":0.0843,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"10.06.2019","dateUnix":1560124800,"priceUSD":0.0793,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"11.06.2019","dateUnix":1560211200,"priceUSD":0.0854,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"12.06.2019","dateUnix":1560297600,"priceUSD":0.0879,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"13.06.2019","dateUnix":1560384000,"priceUSD":0.0962,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"14.06.2019","dateUnix":1560470400,"priceUSD":0.0898,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"15.06.2019","dateUnix":1560556800,"priceUSD":0.0903,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"16.06.2019","dateUnix":1560643200,"priceUSD":0.0915,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"17.06.2019",

In many systems each client downloads and verifies every new proof, and so proofs must be small and cheap to verify. The most practical schemes require either a trusted setup, as in (pre-processing) zk-SNARKs, or verification complexity that scales linearly with the complexity of the relation, as in Bulletproofs. The structured reference strings required by most zk-SNARK schemes can be constructed with multi-party computation protocols, but the resulting parameters are specific to an individual relation. Groth et al. discovered a zk-SNARK protocol with a universal and updateable structured reference string, however the string scales quadratically in the size of the supported relations.","Here we describe a zero-knowledge SNARK, Sonic, which sup- ports a universal and continually updateable structured reference string that scales linearly in size. Sonic proofs are constant size, and in the batch verification context the marginal cost of verification is comparable with the most efficient SNARKs in the literature.

via the longest-chain rule have emerged as a powerful algorithmic tool for consensus algorithms. The technique—popularized by the Bitcoin protocol—has proven to be remarkably flexible and now supports consensus algorithms in a wide variety of settings. Despite such broad applicability and adoption, current analytic understanding of the technique is highly dependent on details of the protocol’s leader election scheme. A particular challenge appears in the proof-of-stake setting, where existing analyses suffer from quadratic dependence on suffix length.","We describe an axiomatic theory of blockchain dynamics that permits rigorous reasoning about the longest-chain rule in quite general circumstances and establish bounds—optimal to within a constant—on the probability of a consistency violation. This settles a critical open question in the proof-of-stake setting where we achieve linear consistency for the first time.","Operationally, blockchain consensus protocols achieve consistency by instructing parties to remove a suffix of a certain length from their local blockchain. While the analysis of Bitcoin guarantees consistency with error 2−k by removing O(k) blocks, recent work on proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchains has suffered from quadratic dependence: (PoS) blockchain protocols, exemplified by Ouroboros (Crypto 2017), Ouroboros Praos (Eurocrypt 2018) and Sleepy Consensus (Asiacrypt 2017), can only establish that the length of this suffix should be Θ(k2). This consistency guarantee is a fundamental design parameter for these systems, as the length of the suffix is a lower bound for the time required to wait for transactions to settle. Whether this gap is an intrinsic limitation of PoS—due to issues such as the “nothing-at-stake” problem—has been an urgent open question as deployed PoS blockchains further rely on consistency for protocol correctness: in particular, security of the protocol itself relies on this parameter. Our general theory directly improves the required suffix length from Θ(k2) to Θ(k). Thus we show, for the first time, how PoS protocols can match proof-of-work blockchain protocols for exponentially decreasing consistency error.","Our analysis focuses on the articulation of a two-dimensional stochastic process that captures the features of interest, an exact recursive closed form for the critical functional of the process, and tail bounds established for associated generating functions that dominate the failure events.

Ethereum chose the account model explicitly to facilitate more expressive smart contracts. On the other hand, Bitcoin chose UTXO also for good reasons, including that its semantic model stays simple in a complex concurrent and distributed computing environment. This raises the question of whether it is possible to have expressive smart contracts, while keeping the semantic simplicity of the UTXO model.","In this paper, we answer this question affirmatively. We present Extended UTXO (EUTXO), an extension to Bitcoin’s UTXO model that supports a substantially more expressive form of validation scripts, including scripts that implement general state machines and enforce invariants across entire transaction chains.","To demonstrate the power of this model, we also introduce a form of state machines suitable for execution on a ledger, based on Mealy machines and called Constraint Emitting Machines (CEM).

We also empirically quantify the sublinear growth of stake shift with the length of the considered lag interval.

Despite its well known use, the mechanism has not been previously formally studied as a primitive. In this paper, we put forth the first cryptographic definition of what a proofof-burn protocol is. It consists of two functions: First, a function which generates a cryptocurrency address. When a user sends money to this address, the money is irrevocably destroyed. Second, a verification function which checks that an address is really unspendable. We propose the following properties for burn protocols. Unspendability, which mandates that an address which verifies correctly as a burn address cannot be used for spending; binding, which allows associating metadata with a particular burn; and uncensorability, which mandates that a burn address is indistinguishable from a regular cryptocurrency address. Our definition captures all previously known proof-of-burn protocols. Next, we design a novel construction for burning which is simple and flexible, making it compatible with all existing popular cryptocurrencies. We prove our scheme is secure in the Random Oracle model. We explore the application of destroying value in a legacy cryptocurrency to bootstrap a new one. The user burns coins in the source blockchain and subsequently creates a proof-of-burn, a short string proving that the burn took place, which she then submits to the destination blockchain to be rewarded with a corresponding amount. The user can use a standard wallet to conduct the burn without requiring specialized software, making our scheme user friendly. We propose burn verification mechanisms with different security guarantees, noting that the target blockchain miners do not necessarily need to monitor the source blockchain. Finally, we implement the verification of Bitcoin burns as an Ethereum smart contract and experimentally measure that the gas costs needed for verification are as low as standard Bitcoin transaction fees, illustrating that our scheme is practical."],"paperURL":"https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/1096.pdf","dateUnix":1580511600,"dateEU":"01.02.2020"},"width":null},{"showTitle":false,"category":"paper","type":"dot","style":null,"position":null,"data":{"paperID":137,"title":"Non-Interactive Proofs of Proof-of-Work","url":"https://iohk.io/en/research/library/papers/non-interactive-proofs-of-proof-of-work/","authors":["Prof Aggelos Kiayias,","Andrew Miller,","Dionysis Zindros"],"tags":["blockchain","cryptocurrency","scalability"],"date":"February 2020","location":"Financial Cryptography 2020","desc":["Open consensus protocols based on proof-of-work (PoW) mining are at the core of cryptocurrencies such Bitcoin and Ethereum, as well as many others.

Non-outsourceable Proof-of-Work schemes have been proposed to tackle these issues. However, tenets in the folklore say that such schemes could potentially be bypassed by using escrow mechanisms. In this work, we propose a concrete example of such a mechanism which is using collateralized smart contracts. Our approach allows miners to bypass non-outsourceable Proof-of-Work schemes if the underlying blockchain platform supports smart contracts in a sufficiently advanced language. In particular, the language should allow access to the PoW solution. At a high level, our approach requires the miner to lock collateral covering the reward amount and protected by a smart contract that acts as an escrow. The smart contract has logic that allows the pool to collect the collateral as soon as the miner collects any block reward. We propose two variants of the approach depending on when the collateral is bound to the block solution. Using this, we show how to bypass previously proposed non-outsourceable Proof-of-Work schemes (with the notable exception for strong non-outsourceable schemes) and show how to build mining pools for such schemes."],"paperURL":"https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/044.pdf","dateUnix":1580511600,"dateEU":"01.02.2020"},"width":null}],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"02.02.2020","dateUnix":1580601600,"priceUSD":0.0555,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"03.02.2020","dateUnix":1580688000,"priceUSD":0.0558,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"04.02.2020","dateUnix":1580774400,"priceUSD":0.0568,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"05.02.2020","dateUnix":1580860800,"priceUSD":0.056,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"06.02.2020","dateUnix":1580947200,"priceUSD":0.059,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"07.02.2020","dateUnix":1581033600,"priceUSD":0.0598,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"08.02.2020","dateUnix":1581120000,"priceUSD":0.0598,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"09.02.2020","dateUnix":1581206400,"priceUSD":0.0602,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"10.02.2020","dateUnix":1581292800,"priceUSD":0.0615,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"11.02.2020","dateUnix":1581379200,"priceUSD":0.0603,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"12.02.2020","dateUnix":1581465600,"priceUSD":0.0629,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"13.02.2020","dateUnix":1581552000,"priceUSD":0.0673,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"14.02.2020","dateUnix":1581638400,"priceUSD":0.0684,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"15.02.2020","dateUnix":1581724800,"priceUSD":0.0703,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"16.02.2020","dateUnix":1581811200,"priceUSD":0.0647,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"17.02.2020","dateUnix":1581897600,"priceUSD":0.0629,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"18.02.2020","dateUnix":1581984000,"priceUSD":0.0605,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"19.02.2020","dateUnix":1582070400,"priceUSD":0.0625,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"20.02.2020","dateUnix":1582156800,"priceUSD":0.0582,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"21.02.2020","dateUnix":1582243200,"priceUSD":0.0578,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"22.02.2020","dateUnix":1582329600,"priceUSD":0.0587,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"23.02.2020","dateUnix":1582416000,"priceUSD":0.0584,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"24.02.2020","dateUnix":1582502400,"priceUSD":0.0607,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"25.02.2020","dateUnix":1582588800,"priceUSD":0.0594,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"26.02.2020","dateUnix":1582675200,"priceUSD":0.0566,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"27.02.2020","dateUnix":1582761600,"priceUSD":0.0506,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"28.02.2020","dateUnix":1582848000,"priceUSD":0.0496,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"29.02.2020","dateUnix":1582934400,"priceUSD":0.0489,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"01.03.2020","dateUnix":1583020800,"priceUSD":0.0474,"markers":[{"showTitle":false,"category":"paper","type":"dot","style":null,"position":null,"data":{"paperID":133,"title":"Full Analysis of Nakamoto Consensus in Bounded-Delay Networks","url":"https://iohk.io/en/research/library/papers/full-analysis-of-nakamoto-consensus-in-bounded-delay-networks/","authors":["Juan Garay,","Prof Aggelos Kiayias,","Nikos Leonardos"],"tags":["blockchain","proof of work"],"date":"March 2020","location":"ePrint Archive","desc":["Nakamoto consensus, arguably the most exciting development in distributed computing in the last few years, is in a sense a recasting of the traditional state-machine-replication problem in an unauthenticated setting, where furthermore parties come and go without warning.

These assumptions have since been somewhat relaxed, first by Pass, Seeman and Shelat [Eurocrypt ’17] who also focused on the simplified version of the protocol but on the bounded-delay model of communication, and by Garay, Kiayias and Leonardos [Crypto ’17] who looked into the full protocol including the PoW difficulty adjustment mechanism with a variable number of parties but assuming synchronous communication and a predetermined schedule of participation. Despite the above progress, the full analysis of the protocol in the more realistic setting of bounded delays and dynamic participation has remained elusive.","This paper’s main result is the proof that Nakamoto’s protocol achieves, under suitable conditions, consistency and liveness in bounded-delay networks with adaptive (as opposed to predetermined) dynamic participation assuming, as before, that the majority of the computational power favors the honest parties.

regulatory issue. In this work, we show the severity of the problem by demonstrating that blockchains can be exploited to surreptitiously distribute arbitrary content. More specifically, all major blockchain systems use randomized cryptographic primitives, such as digital signatures and non-interactive zeroknowledge proofs; we illustrate how the uncontrolled randomness in such primitives can be maliciously manipulated to enable covert communication and hidden persistent storage. To clarify the potential risk, we design, implement and evaluate our technique against the widely-used ECDSA signature scheme, the CryptoNote’s ring signature scheme, and Monero’s ring confidential transactions. Importantly, the significance of the demonstrated attacks stems from their undetectability, their adverse effect on the future of decentralized blockchains, and their serious repercussions on users’ privacy and crypto funds.

In this work we present for the first time a full formalisation and security analysis of the lightning network in the (global) universal composition setting that takes into account a global ledger functionality for which previous work [Badertscher et al., Crypto’17] has demonstrated its realisability by the Bitcoin blockchain protocol. As a result, our treatment delineates exactly how the security guarantees of the protocol depend on the properties of the underlying ledger. Moreover, we provide a complete and modular description of the core of the lightning protocol that highlights precisely its dependency to underlying basic cryptographic primitives such as digital signatures, pseudorandom functions, identity-based signatures and a less common two-party primitive, which we term a combined digital signature, that were originally hidden within the lightning protocol’s implementation."],"paperURL":"https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/778.pdf","dateUnix":1590962400,"dateEU":"01.06.2020"},"width":null}],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"02.06.2020","dateUnix":1591056000,"priceUSD":0.0808,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"03.06.2020","dateUnix":1591142400,"priceUSD":0.0785,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"04.06.2020","dateUnix":1591228800,"priceUSD":0.0846,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"05.06.2020","dateUnix":1591315200,"priceUSD":0.0876,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"06.06.2020","dateUnix":1591401600,"priceUSD":0.0852,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"07.06.2020","dateUnix":1591488000,"priceUSD":0.0862,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"08.06.2020","dateUnix":1591574400,"priceUSD":0.0864,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"09.06.2020","dateUnix":1591660800,"priceUSD":0.0865,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"10.06.2020","dateUnix":1591747200,"priceUSD":0.0831,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"11.06.2020","dateUnix":1591833600,"priceUSD":0.0836,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"12.06.2020","dateUnix":1591920000,"priceUSD":0.0755,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"13.06.2020","dateUnix":1592006400,"priceUSD":0.0794,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"14.06.2020","dateUnix":1592092800,"priceUSD":0.079,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"15.06.2020","dateUnix":1592179200,"priceUSD":0.0765,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"16.06.2020","dateUnix":1592265600,"priceUSD":0.0783,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"17.06.2020","dateUnix":1592352000,"priceUSD":0.0789,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"18.06.2020","dateUnix":1592438400,"priceUSD":0.0834,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"19.06.2020","dateUnix":1592524800,"priceUSD":0.0821,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"20.06.2020","dateUnix":1592611200,"priceUSD":0.0798,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"21.06.2020","dateUnix":1592697600,"priceUSD":0.0794,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"22.06.2020","dateUnix":1592784000,"priceUSD":0.0783,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"23.06.2020","dateUnix":1592870400,"priceUSD":0.0836,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"24.06.2020","dateUnix":1592956800,"priceUSD":0.0828,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"25.06.2020","dateUnix":1593043200,"priceUSD":0.0825,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"26.06.2020","dateUnix":1593129600,"priceUSD":0.0816,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"27.06.2020","dateUnix":1593216000,"priceUSD":0.0806,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"28.06.2020","dateUnix":1593302400,"priceUSD":0.0775,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"29.06.2020","dateUnix":1593388800,"priceUSD":0.0803,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"30.06.2020","dateUnix":1593475200,"priceUSD":0.0838,"markers":[{"category":"node-release","type":"node","data":{"name":"Cardano Node 1.14.2","published_at":"2020-06-30T17:09:02Z","html_url":"https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node/releases/tag/1.14.2","tag_name":"1.14.2","tag_name_number":"1142","published_at_unix":1593536942,"published_at_EU":"30.06.2020","position":1}}],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null,"position":1,"singleContain":"node-release"},{"dateEU":"01.07.2020","dateUnix":1593561600,"priceUSD":0.0831,"markers":[{"showTitle":false,"category":"paper","type":"dot","style":null,"position":null,"data":{"paperID":129,"title":"SoK: A Taxonomy of Cryptocurrency Wallets","url":"https://iohk.io/en/research/library/papers/sok-a-taxonomy-of-cryptocurrency-wallets/","authors":["Kostis Karantias"],"tags":["wallet"],"date":"July 2020","location":"ePrint Archive","desc":["The primary function of a cryptocurrency is money transfer between individuals.

Our mechanism works even if the underlying smart contract is not designed to operate with the derivative smart contract. Like in traditional finance, derivatives derive their value (and more generally state) through potentially complex dependencies. We show how derivative smart contracts can be deployed in practice on the Ethereum blockchain without any forks or additional assumptions. We leverage any NIPoPoWs mechanism (such as FlyClient or superblocks) to obtain succinct proofs for arbitrary events, making proving them inexpensive for users. The latter construction is of particular interest, as it forms the first introspective SPV client: an SPV client for Ethereum in Ethereum.

In contrast to most other secure communication protocols (such as TLS, SSH, or Wireguard), SM sessions may be long-lived (e.g., years) and highly asynchronous. In order to deal with likely state compromises of users during the lifetime of a session, SM protocols do not only protect authenticity and privacy, but they also guarantee forward secrecy (FS) and post-compromise security (PCS). The former ensures that messages sent and received before a state compromise remain secure, while the latter ensures that users can recover from state compromise as a consequence of normal protocol usage.","SM has received considerable attention in the two-party case, where prior work has studied the well-known double-ratchet paradigm in particular and SM as a cryptographic primitive in general. Unfortunately, this paradigm does not scale well to the problem of secure group messaging (SGM). In order to address the lack of satisfactory SGM protocols, the IETF has launched the message-layer security (MLS) working group, which aims to standardize an eponymous SGM protocol. In this work we analyze the TreeKEM protocol, which is at the core of the SGM protocol proposed by the MLS working group.","On a positive note, we show that TreeKEM achieves PCS in isolation (and slightly more). However, we observe that the current version of TreeKEM does not provide an adequate form of FS. More precisely, our work proceeds by formally capturing the exact security of TreeKEM as a so-called continuous group key agreement (CGKA) protocol, which we believe to be a primitive of independent interest. To address the insecurity of TreeKEM, we propose a simple modification to TreeKEM inspired by recent work of Jost et al. (EUROCRYPT '19) and an idea due to Kohbrok (MLS Mailing List). We then show that the modified version of TreeKEM comes with almost no efficiency degradation but achieves optimal (according to MLS specification) CGKA security, including FS and PCS. Our work also lays out how a CGKA protocol can be used to design a full SGM protocol.","Finally, we propose and motivate an extensive list of potential future research directions for the area."],"paperURL":"https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/1189.pdf","dateUnix":1596232800,"dateEU":"01.08.2020"},"width":null},{"showTitle":false,"category":"paper","type":"dot","style":null,"position":null,"data":{"paperID":125,"title":"Introduction to the design of the Data Diffusion and Networking for Cardano Shelley*","url":"https://iohk.io/en/research/library/papers/introduction-to-the-design-of-the-data-diffusion-and-networking-for-cardano-shelley/","authors":["Duncan Coutts,","Neil Davies,","Marcin Szamotulski,","Peter Thompson"],"tags":["networking"],"date":"August 2020","location":"IOHK","desc":[],"paperURL":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/478201/items/5P4V3WEG/file/view?key=PnpP8O1NApZMMF0LVNh7I4I5","dateUnix":1596232800,"dateEU":"01.08.2020"},"width":null},{"showTitle":false,"category":"paper","type":"dot","style":null,"position":null,"data":{"paperID":126,"title":"Flexible Formality: Practical Experience with Agile Formal Methods","url":"https://iohk.io/en/research/library/papers/flexible-formality-practical-experience-with-agile-formal-methods/","authors":["Philipp Kant,","Kevin Hammond,","Duncan Coutts,","James Chapman,","Nicholas Clarke,","Jared Corduan,","Neil Davies,","Javier Roberto Diaz,","Matthias Güdemann,","Wolfgang Jeltsch,","Marcin Szamotulski,","Polina Vinogradova"],"tags":[],"date":"August 2020","location":"TFP '20 (LNCS)","desc":["Agile software development and Formal Methods are traditionally seen as being in conflict.

In this paper, we contribute to the refutation of this stereotype, by providing a real-world example of using good practices from formal methods and agile software engineering to deliver software that is simultaneously reliable, effective, testable, and that can also be iterated and delivered rapidly. We thus present how a lightweight software engineering methodology, drawing from appropriate formal methods techniques and providing the benefits of agile software development, can look like.

We emphasise this threat by quantifying the damage a functional quantum computer could inflict on Bitcoin (and Bitcoin Cash) by breaking exposed public keys."],"paperURL":"https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/186.pdf","dateUnix":1596232800,"dateEU":"01.08.2020"},"width":null}],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"02.08.2020","dateUnix":1596326400,"priceUSD":0.1448,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"03.08.2020","dateUnix":1596412800,"priceUSD":0.1337,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"04.08.2020","dateUnix":1596499200,"priceUSD":0.137,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"05.08.2020","dateUnix":1596585600,"priceUSD":0.1428,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"06.08.2020","dateUnix":1596672000,"priceUSD":0.1425,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"07.08.2020","dateUnix":1596758400,"priceUSD":0.1438,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"08.08.2020","dateUnix":1596844800,"priceUSD":0.1386,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"09.08.2020","dateUnix":1596931200,"priceUSD":0.1457,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"10.08.2020","dateUnix":1597017600,"priceUSD":0.1449,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"11.08.2020","dateUnix":1597104000,"priceUSD":0.1433,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"12.08.2020","dateUnix":1597190400,"priceUSD":0.1371,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"13.08.2020","dateUnix":1597276800,"priceUSD":0.1365,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"14.08.2020","dateUnix":1597363200,"priceUSD":0.1393,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"15.08.2020","dateUnix":1597449600,"priceUSD":0.1383,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"16.08.2020","dateUnix":1597536000,"priceUSD":0.1382,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"17.08.2020","dateUnix":1597622400,"priceUSD":0.1388,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"18.08.2020","dateUnix":1597708800,"priceUSD":0.1407,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"19.08.2020","dateUnix":1597795200,"priceUSD":0.137,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"20.08.2020","dateUnix":1597881600,"priceUSD":0.1294,"markers":[{"category":"node-release","type":"node","data":{"name":"Cardano Node 1.19.0","published_at":"2020-08-20T20:20:07Z","html_url":"https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node/releases/tag/1.19.0","tag_name":"1.19.0","tag_name_number":"1190","published_at_unix":1597954807,"published_at_EU":"20.08.2020","position":2}}],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null,"position":2,"singleContain":"node-release"},{"dateEU":"21.08.2020","dateUnix":1597968000,"priceUSD":0.1342,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"22.08.2020","dateUnix":1598054400,"priceUSD":0.1226,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"23.08.2020","dateUnix":1598140800,"priceUSD":0.1253,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"24.08.2020","dateUnix":1598227200,"priceUSD":0.1216,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"25.08.2020","dateUnix":1598313600,"priceUSD":0.1237,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"26.08.2020","dateUnix":1598400000,"priceUSD":0.1126,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"27.08.2020","dateUnix":1598486400,"priceUSD":0.1145,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"28.08.2020","dateUnix":1598572800,"priceUSD":0.1068,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"29.08.2020","dateUnix":1598659200,"priceUSD":0.1092,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"30.08.2020","dateUnix":1598745600,"priceUSD":0.1166,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"31.08.2020","dateUnix":1598832000,"priceUSD":0.1172,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"01.09.2020","dateUnix":1598918400,"priceUSD":0.1221,"markers":[{"showTitle":false,"category":"paper","type":"dot","style":null,"position":null,"data":{"paperID":118,"title":"Upper Bound Probability of Double Spend Attack on SPECTRE","url":"https://iohk.io/en/research/library/papers/upper-bound-probability-of-double-spend-attack-on-spectre/","authors":["Lyudmila Kovalchuk,","Mariia Rodinko,","Prof Roman Oliynykov"],"tags":["proof of work"],"date":"September 2020","location":"CryBlock '20","desc":["We obtained analytical expressions of upper estimates for success probability of a double spend attack on DAG-based consensus protocol SPECTRE, depending on network parameters.

The activation of such changes might jeopardize the integrity of the blockchain by resulting in chain splits. Moreover, the software update process should be handed over to the community and this means that the blockchain should support updates without relying on a trusted party. In this paper, we introduce the notion of updatable blockchains and show how to construct blockchains that satisfy this definition. Informally, an updatable blockchain is a secure blockchain and in addition it allows to update its protocol preserving the history of the chain. In this work, we focus only on the processes that allow securely switching from one blockchain protocol to another assuming that the blockchain protocols are correct. That is, we do not aim at providing a mechanism that allows reaching consensus on what is the code of the new blockchain protocol. We just assume that such a mechanism exists (like the one proposed in NDSS 2019 by Zhang et. al), and show how to securely go from the old protocol to the new one. The contribution of this paper can be summarized as follows. We provide the first formal definition of updatable ledgers and propose the description of two compilers. These compilers take a blockchain and turn it into an updatable blockchain. The first compiler requires the structure of the current and the updated blockchain to be very similar (only the structure of the blocks can be different) but it allows for an update process more simple, efficient. The second compiler that we propose is very generic (i.e., makes few assumptions on the similarities between the structure of the current blockchain and the update blockchain). The drawback of this compiler is that it requires the new blockchain to be resilient against a specific adversarial behaviour and requires all the honest parties to be online during the update process. However, we show how to get rid of the latest requirement (the honest parties being online during the update) in the case of proof-of-work and proof-of-stake ledgers."],"paperURL":"https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/887.pdf","dateUnix":1598911200,"dateEU":"01.09.2020"},"width":null},{"showTitle":false,"category":"paper","type":"dot","style":null,"position":null,"data":{"paperID":120,"title":"Reward Sharing Schemes for Stake Pools","url":"https://iohk.io/en/research/library/papers/reward-sharing-schemes-for-stake-pools/","authors":["Lars Brünjes,","Prof Aggelos Kiayias,","Prof Elias Koutsoupias,","Aikaterini-Panagiota Stouka"],"tags":["game theory","incentives","proof of stake","stake pool"],"date":"September 2020","location":"Euro S&P 2020","desc":["We introduce and study reward sharing schemes that promote the fair formation of stake pools in collaborative projects that involve a large number of stakeholders such as the maintenance of a proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain.

If users are offline and abstain from the PoS consensus mechanism, the system’s security is at risk, so it is imperative to explore ways to both maximize the level of participation and minimize the effects of non-participation. One such option is stake representation, such that users can delegate their participation rights and, in the process, form “stake pools”. The core idea is that stake pool operators always participate on behalf of regular users, while the users retain the ownership of their assets. Our work provides a formal PoS wallet construction that enables delegation and stake pool formation. While investigating the construction of addresses in this setting, we distil and explore address malleability, a security property that captures the ability of an attacker to manipulate the delegation information associated with an address. Our analysis consists of identifying multiple levels of malleability, which are taken into account in our paper’s core result. We then introduce the first ideal functionality of a PoS wallet’s core which captures the PoS wallet’s capabilities and is realized as a secure protocol based on standard cryptographic primitives.

This makes them unnecessarily inefficient, expensive, and complex. It also makes them insecure as numerous incidents on Ethereum have demonstrated. Even without stateful smart contracts, the lack of perfect fungibility of Bitcoin assets allows for implementing user-defined tokens as layer-two solutions, which also adds an additional layer of complexity. In this paper, we explore an alternative design based on Bitcoin-style UTXO ledgers. Instead of introducing general scripting capabilities together with the associated security risks, we propose an extension of the UTXO model, where we replace the accounting structure of a single cryptocurrency with a new structure that manages an unbounded number of user defined, native tokens, which we call token bundles. Token creation is controlled by forging policy scripts that, just like Bitcoin validator scripts, use a small domain-specific language with bounded computational expressiveness, thus favouring Bitcoin’s security and computational austerity. The resulting approach is lightweight, i.e., custom asset creation and transfer is cheap, and it avoids use of any global state in the form of an asset registry or similar.

User-defined tokens are nonnative on Ethereum; i.e., they are not directly supported by the ledger, but require custom code. This makes them unnecessarily inefficient, expensive, and complex. The Extended UTXO Model (EUTXO) (WTSC'20) has been introduced as a generalisation of Bitcoinstyle UTXO ledgers, allowing support of more expressive smart contracts, approaching the functionality available to contracts on Ethereum. Specifically, a bisimulation argument established a formal relationship between the EUTXO ledger and a general form of state machines. Nevertheless, transaction outputs in the EUTXO model lock integral quantities of a single native cryptocurrency only, just like Bitcoin. In this paper, we study a generalisation of the EUTXO ledger model with native user-defined tokens. Following the approach proposed in a companion paper [4] for the simpler case of plain Bitcoin-style UTXO ledgers, we generalise transaction outputs to lock not merely coins of a single cryptocurrency, but entire token bundles, including custom tokens whose forging is controlled by forging policy scripts. We show that this leads to a rich ledger model that supports a broad range of interesting use cases. Our main technical contribution is a formalisation of the multi-asset EUTXO ledger in Agda, which we use to establish that the ledger with custom tokens is strictly more expressive than the original EUTXO ledger.

Such clients can be embedded within othe blockchains by implementing them as smart contracts, allowing for cross-chain verification. One such interesting instance is the consumption of Bitcoin data within Ethereum by implementing a Bitcoin superlight client in Solidity. While such theoretical constructions have demonstrated security and efficiency in theory, no practical implementation exists. In this work, we put forth the first practical Solidity implementation of a superlight client which implements the NIPoPoW superblocks protocol. Contrary to previous work, our Solidity smart contract achieves sufficient gas-efficiency to allow a proof and counter-proof to fit within the gas limit of a block, making it practical. We provide extensive experimental measurements for gas consumption. The optimizations that enable gas-efficiency heavily leverage a novel technique which we term hash-and-resubmit, which almost completely eliminates persistent storage requirements, the most expensive operation of smart contracts in terms of gas. Instead, the contract asks contesters to resubmit data and checks their veracity by hashing it. Other optimizations include off-chain manipulation of proofs in order to remove expensive look-up structures, and the usage of an optimistic schema. We show that such techniques can be used to bring down gas costs significantly and may be of independent interest. Lastly, our implementation allows us to calculate concrete cryptoeconomic parameters for the superblocks NIPoPoWs protocol and in particular to make recommendations about the monetary value of the collateral parameters. We provide such parameter recommendations over a variety of liveness settings."],"paperURL":"https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/927.pdf","dateUnix":1601503200,"dateEU":"01.10.2020"},"width":null}],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"02.10.2020","dateUnix":1601596800,"priceUSD":0.0981,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"03.10.2020","dateUnix":1601683200,"priceUSD":0.0928,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"04.10.2020","dateUnix":1601769600,"priceUSD":0.0933,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"05.10.2020","dateUnix":1601856000,"priceUSD":0.0972,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"06.10.2020","dateUnix":1601942400,"priceUSD":0.0974,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"07.10.2020","dateUnix":1602028800,"priceUSD":0.0928,"markers":[{"category":"node-release","type":"node","data":{"name":"Cardano Node 1.21.1","published_at":"2020-10-07T15:39:59Z","html_url":"https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node/releases/tag/1.21.1","tag_name":"1.21.1","tag_name_number":"1211","published_at_unix":1602085199,"published_at_EU":"07.10.2020","position":1}}],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null,"position":1,"singleContain":"node-release"},{"dateEU":"08.10.2020","dateUnix":1602115200,"priceUSD":0.0936,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"09.10.2020","dateUnix":1602201600,"priceUSD":0.0962,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"10.10.2020","dateUnix":1602288000,"priceUSD":0.1019,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"11.10.2020","dateUnix":1602374400,"priceUSD":0.105,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"12.10.2020","dateUnix":1602460800,"priceUSD":0.1063,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"13.10.2020","dateUnix":1602547200,"priceUSD":0.1098,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"14.10.2020","dateUnix":1602633600,"priceUSD":0.109,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"15.10.2020","dateUnix":1602720000,"priceUSD":0.1075,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"16.10.2020","dateUnix":1602806400,"priceUSD":0.1064,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"17.10.2020","dateUnix":1602892800,"priceUSD":0.1041,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"18.10.2020","dateUnix":1602979200,"priceUSD":0.1061,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"19.10.2020","dateUnix":1603065600,"priceUSD":0.1075,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"20.10.2020","dateUnix":1603152000,"priceUSD":0.1088,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"21.10.2020","dateUnix":1603238400,"priceUSD":0.1023,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"22.10.2020","dateUnix":1603324800,"priceUSD":0.1058,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"23.10.2020","dateUnix":1603411200,"priceUSD":0.1104,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"24.10.2020","dateUnix":1603497600,"priceUSD":0.1079,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"25.10.2020","dateUnix":1603584000,"priceUSD":0.108,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"26.10.2020","dateUnix":1603670400,"priceUSD":0.1063,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"27.10.2020","dateUnix":1603756800,"priceUSD":0.1033,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"28.10.2020","dateUnix":1603843200,"priceUSD":0.1027,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"29.10.2020","dateUnix":1603929600,"priceUSD":0.0989,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"30.10.2020","dateUnix":1604016000,"priceUSD":0.0953,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"31.10.2020","dateUnix":1604102400,"priceUSD":0.0932,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"01.11.2020","dateUnix":1604188800,"priceUSD":0.0929,"markers":[{"showTitle":false,"category":"paper","type":"dot","style":null,"position":null,"data":{"paperID":104,"title":"Zendoo: a zk-SNARK Verifiable Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol Enabling Decoupled and Decentralized Sidechains","url":"https://iohk.io/en/research/library/papers/zendoo-a-zk-snark-verifiable-cross-chain-transfer-protocol-enabling-decoupled-and-decentralized-sidechains/","authors":["Alberto Garoffolo,","Dmytro Kaidalov,","Prof Roman Oliynykov"],"tags":["blockchain","sidechains","zero knowledge"],"date":"November 2020","location":"BlockApp 2020","desc":["Sidechains are an appealing innovation devised to enable blockchain scalability and extensibility.

Due to sessions' long life-time, CGKA protocols must simultaneously ensure both post-compromise security and forward secrecy (PCFS).

ISPs enable the concise and modular specification of blockchain protocols, and may be of independent interest."],"paperURL":"https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/315.pdf","dateUnix":1604185200,"dateEU":"01.11.2020"},"width":null}],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"02.11.2020","dateUnix":1604275200,"priceUSD":0.0977,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"03.11.2020","dateUnix":1604361600,"priceUSD":0.0925,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"04.11.2020","dateUnix":1604448000,"priceUSD":0.0936,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"05.11.2020","dateUnix":1604534400,"priceUSD":0.0954,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"06.11.2020","dateUnix":1604620800,"priceUSD":0.0975,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"07.11.2020","dateUnix":1604707200,"priceUSD":0.1089,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"08.11.2020","dateUnix":1604793600,"priceUSD":0.1014,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"09.11.2020","dateUnix":1604880000,"priceUSD":0.1064,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"10.11.2020","dateUnix":1604966400,"priceUSD":0.1054,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"11.11.2020","dateUnix":1605052800,"priceUSD":0.1056,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"12.11.2020","dateUnix":1605139200,"priceUSD":0.1058,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"13.11.2020","dateUnix":1605225600,"priceUSD":0.1044,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"14.11.2020","dateUnix":1605312000,"priceUSD":0.1063,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"15.11.2020","dateUnix":1605398400,"priceUSD":0.1043,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"16.11.2020","dateUnix":1605484800,"priceUSD":0.1007,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"17.11.2020","dateUnix":1605571200,"priceUSD":0.1039,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"18.11.2020","dateUnix":1605657600,"priceUSD":0.1095,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"19.11.2020","dateUnix":1605744000,"priceUSD":0.1068,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"20.11.2020","dateUnix":1605830400,"priceUSD":0.1058,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"21.11.2020","dateUnix":1605916800,"priceUSD":0.1176,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"22.11.2020","dateUnix":1606003200,"priceUSD":0.1327,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"23.11.2020","dateUnix":1606089600,"priceUSD":0.1453,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"24.11.2020","dateUnix":1606176000,"priceUSD":0.1536,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"25.11.2020","dateUnix":1606262400,"priceUSD":0.1668,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"26.11.2020","dateUnix":1606348800,"priceUSD":0.1557,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"27.11.2020","dateUnix":1606435200,"priceUSD":0.1375,"markers":[{"category":"node-release","type":"node","data":{"name":"Cardano Node 1.23.0","published_at":"2020-11-27T17:19:07Z","html_url":"https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node/releases/tag/1.23.0","tag_name":"1.23.0","tag_name_number":"1230","published_at_unix":1606497547,"published_at_EU":"27.11.2020","position":3}}],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null,"position":3,"singleContain":"node-release"},{"dateEU":"28.11.2020","dateUnix":1606521600,"priceUSD":0.1406,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"29.11.2020","dateUnix":1606608000,"priceUSD":0.1647,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"30.11.2020","dateUnix":1606694400,"priceUSD":0.1664,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"01.12.2020","dateUnix":1606780800,"priceUSD":0.1705,"markers":[{"showTitle":false,"category":"paper","type":"dot","style":null,"position":null,"data":{"paperID":102,"title":"Security Limitations of Classical-Client Delegated Quantum Computing","url":"https://iohk.io/en/research/library/papers/security-limitations-of-classical-client-delegated-quantum-computing/","authors":["Christian Badertscher,","Alexandru Cojocaru,","Leo Colisson,","Elham Kashefi,","Dominik Leichtle,","Atul Mantri,","Petros Wallden"],"tags":["quantum"],"date":"December 2020","location":"Asiacrypt 2020","desc":["Secure delegated quantum computing allows a computationally weak client to outsource an arbitrary quantum computation to an untrusted quantum server in a privacy-preserving manner. One of the promising candidates to achieve classical delegation of quantum computation is classical-client remote state preparation (RSPCC), where a client remotely prepares a quantum state using a classical channel. However, the privacy loss incurred by employing RSPCC as a sub-module is unclear.","In this work, we investigate this question using the Constructive Cryptography framework by Maurer and Renner (ICS'11). We first identify the goal of RSPCC as the construction of ideal RSP resources from classical channels and then reveal the security limitations of using RSPCC. First, we uncover a fundamental relationship between constructing ideal RSP resources (from classical channels) and the task of cloning quantum states. Any classically constructed ideal RSP resource must leak to the server the full classical description (possibly in an encoded form) of the generated quantum state, even if we target computational security only. As a consequence, we find that the realization of common RSP resources, without weakening their guarantees drastically, is impossible due to the no-cloning theorem. Second, the above result does not rule out that a specific RSPCC protocol can replace the quantum channel at least in some contexts, such as the Universal Blind Quantum Computing (UBQC) protocol of Broadbent et al. (FOCS '09). However, we show that the resulting UBQC protocol cannot maintain its proven composable security as soon as RSPCC is used as a subroutine. Third, we show that replacing the quantum channel of the above UBQC protocol by the RSPCC protocol QFactory of Cojocaru et al. (Asiacrypt '19), preserves the weaker, game-based, security of UBQC."],"paperURL":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.01668.pdf","dateUnix":1606777200,"dateEU":"01.12.2020"},"width":null},{"showTitle":false,"category":"paper","type":"dot","style":null,"position":null,"data":{"paperID":103,"title":"Lightweight Virtual Payment Channels","url":"https://iohk.io/en/research/library/papers/lightweight-virtual-payment-channels/","authors":["Maxim Jourenko,","Mario Larangeira,","Keisuke Tanaka"],"tags":["payment channels"],"date":"December 2020","location":"CANS '20","desc":["Blockchain systems have severe scalability limitations e.g., long confirmation delays. Layer-2 protocols are designed to address such limitations. The most prominent class of such protocols are payment channel networks e.g., the Lightning Network for Bitcoin where pairs of participants create channels that can be concatenated into networks. These allow payments across the network without interaction with the blockchain. A drawback is that all intermediary nodes within a payment path must be online. Virtual Channels, as recently proposed by Dziembowski et al. (CCS'18), allow payments without this limitation. However, these can only be implemented on blockchains with smart contract capability therefore limiting its applicability. Our work proposes the notion of --Lightweight-- Virtual Payment Channels, i.e. only requiring timelocks and multisignatures, enabling Virtual Channels on a larger range of blockchain systems of which a prime example is Bitcoin.

Such a payment requires each party to lock away funds for an amount of time. The product of funds and locktime is the collateral of the party, i.e., their cost of opportunity to forward a payment. In the case of HTLC, the locktime is linear to the length of the path, making the total collateral invested across the path quadratic in size of its length. Sprites improved on this by reducing the locktime to a constant by utilizing smart contracts. Atomic Multi-Channel Updates (AMCU), published at CCS’19, introduced constant collateral payments without smart contracts. In this work we present the Channel Closure attack on AMCU that allows a malicious adversary to make honest parties lose funds.

Our work investigates techniques that minimize the shared state of the distributed ledger, i.e., the in-memory UTxO set. To this end, we follow two directions: a) we propose novel transaction optimization techniques to be followed by wallets, so as to create transactions that reduce the shared state cost and b) propose a novel fee scheme that incentivizes the creation of “state-friendly” transactions. We devise an abstract ledger model, expressed via a series of algebraic operators, and define the transaction optimization problem of minimizing the shared state; we also propose a multi-layered algorithm that approximates the optimal solution to this problem. Finally, we define the necessary conditions such that a ledger’s fee scheme incentivizes proper state management and propose a state efficient fee function for Bitcoin."],"paperURL":"https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/183.pdf","dateUnix":1614553200,"dateEU":"01.03.2021"},"width":null}],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"02.03.2021","dateUnix":1614643200,"priceUSD":1.3029,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"03.03.2021","dateUnix":1614729600,"priceUSD":1.2288,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"04.03.2021","dateUnix":1614816000,"priceUSD":1.2197,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"05.03.2021","dateUnix":1614902400,"priceUSD":1.1178,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"06.03.2021","dateUnix":1614988800,"priceUSD":1.1648,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"07.03.2021","dateUnix":1615075200,"priceUSD":1.133,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"08.03.2021","dateUnix":1615161600,"priceUSD":1.1368,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"09.03.2021","dateUnix":1615248000,"priceUSD":1.1233,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"10.03.2021","dateUnix":1615334400,"priceUSD":1.1887,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"11.03.2021","dateUnix":1615420800,"priceUSD":1.1354,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"12.03.2021","dateUnix":1615507200,"priceUSD":1.1283,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"13.03.2021","dateUnix":1615593600,"priceUSD":1.0366,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"14.03.2021","dateUnix":1615680000,"priceUSD":1.1022,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"15.03.2021","dateUnix":1615766400,"priceUSD":1.0648,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"16.03.2021","dateUnix":1615852800,"priceUSD":1.0314,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"17.03.2021","dateUnix":1615939200,"priceUSD":1.2457,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"18.03.2021","dateUnix":1616025600,"priceUSD":1.383,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"19.03.2021","dateUnix":1616112000,"priceUSD":1.2367,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"20.03.2021","dateUnix":1616198400,"priceUSD":1.302,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"21.03.2021","dateUnix":1616284800,"priceUSD":1.2074,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"22.03.2021","dateUnix":1616371200,"priceUSD":1.1892,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"23.03.2021","dateUnix":1616457600,"priceUSD":1.1069,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"24.03.2021","dateUnix":1616544000,"priceUSD":1.127,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"25.03.2021","dateUnix":1616630400,"priceUSD":1.0615,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"26.03.2021","dateUnix":1616716800,"priceUSD":1.097,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"27.03.2021","dateUnix":1616803200,"priceUSD":1.2126,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"28.03.2021","dateUnix":1616889600,"priceUSD":1.1779,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"29.03.2021","dateUnix":1616976000,"priceUSD":1.1911,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"30.03.2021","dateUnix":1617062400,"priceUSD":1.201,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"31.03.2021","dateUnix":1617148800,"priceUSD":1.2114,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":null,"tvlADA":null},{"dateEU":"01.04.2021","dateUnix":1617235200,"priceUSD":1.1922,"markers":[{"showTitle":false,"category":"paper","type":"dot","style":null,"position":null,"data":{"paperID":89,"title":"Impossibility on Tamper-Resilient Cryptography with Uniqueness Properties","url":"https://iohk.io/en/research/library/papers/impossibility-on-tamper-resilient-cryptography-with-uniqueness-properties/","authors":["Yuyu Wang,","Takahiro Matsuda,","Goichiro Hanaoka,","Keisuke Tanaka"],"tags":["cryptography"],"date":"April 2021","location":"EPrint Archive","desc":["In this work, we show negative results on the tamper-resilience of a wide class of cryptographic primitives with uniqueness properties, such as unique signatures, verifiable random functions, signatures with unique keys, injective one-way functions, and encryption schemes with a property we call unique-message property.

During these periods an attacker can mount devastating attacks, such as double spending or censorship of transactions. Checkpointing has been proposed as a mechanism to mitigate such 51% attacks. The core idea is to employ an external set of parties that securely run an assisting service which guarantees the ledger's properties and can be relied upon at times when the invested hashing power is low. We realize the assisting service in two ways, via checkpointing and timestamping, and show that a ledger, which employs either, is secure with high probability, even in the presence of an adversarial mining majority. We put forth the first rigorous study of checkpointing as a mechanism to protect PoW ledgers from 51% attacks. Notably, our design is the first to offer both consistency and liveness guarantees, even under adversarial mining majorities. Our liveness analysis also identifies a previously undocumented attack, namely front-running, which enables Denial-of-Service against existing checkpointed ledger systems. We showcase the liveness guarantees of our mechanism by evaluating the checkpointed version of Ethereum Classic, a blockchain which recently suffered a 51% attack, and build a federated distributed checkpointing service, which provides high assurance with low performance requirements. Finally, we prove the security of our timestamping mechanism, build a fully decentralized timestamping solution, by utilizing a secure distributed ledger, and evaluate its performance on the existing Bitcoin and Ethereum systems."],"paperURL":"https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/173.pdf","dateUnix":1619820000,"dateEU":"01.05.2021"},"width":null},{"showTitle":false,"category":"paper","type":"dot","style":null,"position":null,"data":{"paperID":86,"title":"RPPLNS: Pay-per-last-N-shares with a Randomised Twist","url":"https://iohk.io/en/research/library/papers/rpplns-pay-per-last-n-shares-with-a-randomised-twist/","authors":["Philip Lazos,","Francisco Marmolejo Cossío,","Xinyu Zhou,","Jonathan Katz"],"tags":["incentives","proof of work"],"date":"May 2021","location":"AAMAS 2021","desc":["“Pay-per-last-N-shares” (PPLNS) is one of the most common payout strategies used by mining pools in Proof-of-Work (PoW) cryptocurrencies.

For PPLNS this question has only been partially answered; we know that reasonably-sized miners within a PPLNS pool prefer following the pool protocol over employing specific deviations. In this paper, we present a novel modification to PPLNS where we randomise the protocol in a natural way. We call our protocol “Randomised pay-per-last-N-shares” (RPPLNS), and note that the randomised structure of the protocol greatly simplifies the study of its incentive compatibility.

Our main motivation is that in case of leakage of the secret key, established techniques based on zero-knowledge proofs of knowledge are void since the key becomes public. On the other hand, the \"back up key\", which is secret, can be used to generate a \"proof of ownership\", i.e., only the real owner of this secret key can generate such a proof. To the best of our knowledge, this extra level of security is novel, and could have already been used in practice, if available, in digital wallets for cryptocurrencies that suffered massive leakage of account private keys. In this work, we formalize the notion of \"Proof of Ownership\" and \"Fallback\" as new properties. Then, we introduce our construction, which is compatible with major designs for wallets based on ECDSA, and adds a W-OTS+ signing key as a \"back up key\". Thus offering a quantum secure fallback. This design allows the hiding of any quantum secure signature key pair, and is not exclusive to W-OTS+.

A stake-pool operates a node that engages in the PoS protocol and potentially represents a large number of smaller stakeholders. While such pooled PoS operation is attractive from various angles, it also exhibits a significant shortcoming that, so far and to the best of our knowledge, has not been sufficiently understood or investigated. Pooled PoS operation, to be effective and not lead to sub-optimal dictatorial or cartel-like configurations, should enable the stakeholders to revoke and re-delegate their stake in a way that is aligned with their incentives. However, given that stake-pool operators are exactly those entities who determine what transactions are to be recorded in the ledger, they are quite likely to form a cartel and censor any transaction they want, such as those that attempt to adjust the current stake-pool lineup. In this way, a power grab takes place, where the stake-pool cartel perpetuates its control over the PoS system. We first model and observe formally the emergence of the above problem in pooled PoS systems, and then we describe an anti-censorship mechanism that takes advantage of the underlying cryptographic functions of the ledger and the nature of peer-to-peer networks to diffuse information without suppression. We provide a thorough game-theoretic analysis of this mechanism discovering various types of Nash equilibria which demonstrate that the \"revolution\", i.e., the strategic decision of pool members to withdraw support from a censoring cartel as well as the pool operators to step down, can be incentivized, under suitable and plausible conditions in the utility functions of the involved participants."],"paperURL":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.08562.pdf","dateUnix":1627768800,"dateEU":"01.08.2021"},"width":null},{"showTitle":false,"category":"paper","type":"dot","style":null,"position":null,"data":{"paperID":77,"title":"Composition with Knowledge Assumptions","url":"https://iohk.io/en/research/library/papers/composition-with-knowledge-assumptions/","authors":["Thomas Kerber,","Prof Aggelos Kiayias,","Markulf Kohlweiss"],"tags":[],"date":"August 2021","location":"Crypto 2021","desc":["Zero-knowledge succinct non-interactive arguments (zk-SNARKs) rely on knowledge assumptions for their security.

For proof-of-work blockchains, two known constructions exist: Superblock and FlyClient. Unfortunately, none of them can be deployed to existing blockchains, as they require consensus changes and at least a soft fork to implement. In this paper, we investigate how a blockchain can be upgraded to support superblock clients without a soft fork. We show that it is possible to implement the needed changes without modifying the consensus protocol and by requiring only a minority of miners to upgrade, a process termed a “velvet fork” in the literature. While previous work conjectured that superblock clients can be safely deployed using velvet forks as-is, we show that previous constructions are insecure, and that using velvet techniques to interlink a blockchain can pose insidious security risks. We describe a novel class of attacks, called “chain-sewing”, which arise in the velvet fork setting: an adversary can cut-and-paste portions of various chains from independent temporary forks, sewing them together to fool a superlight client into accepting a false claim. We show how previous velvet fork constructions can be attacked via chain-sewing. Next, we put forth the first provably secure velvet superblock client construction which we show secure against adversaries that are bounded by 1/3 of the upgraded honest miner population. Like non-velvet superlight clients, our approach allows proving generic predicates about chains using infix proofs and as such can be adopted in practice for fast synchronization of transactions and accounts."],"paperURL":"https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3479722.3480999","dateUnix":1630447200,"dateEU":"01.09.2021"},"width":null},{"showTitle":false,"category":"paper","type":"dot","style":null,"position":null,"data":{"paperID":73,"title":"Coalition-Safe Equilibria with Virtual Payoffs","url":"https://iohk.io/en/research/library/papers/coalition-safe-equilibria-with-virtual-payoffs/","authors":["Prof Aggelos Kiayias,","Aikaterini-Panagiota Stouka"],"tags":["game theory"],"date":"September 2021","location":"AFT'21","desc":["Consider a set of parties invited to execute a protocol Π. The protocol will incur some cost to run while in the end (or at regular intervals), it will populate and update local tables that assign (virtual) rewards to participants. Each participant aspires to offset the costs of participation by these virtual payoffs that are provided in the course of the protocol. In this setting, we introduce and study a notion of coalition-safe equilibrium. In particular, we consider a strategic coalition of participants that is centrally coordinated and potentially deviates from Π with the objective to increase its utility with respect to the view of at least one of the other participants. The protocol Π is called a coalition-safe equilibrium with virtual payoffs (EVP) if no such protocol deviation exists. We apply our notion to study incentives in blockchain protocols. Compared to prior work, our framework has the advantages that it simultaneously (i) takes into account that each participant may have a divergent view of the rewards given to the other participants, as the reward mechanism employed is subject to consensus among players (and our notion is well defined independently of whether the underlying protocol achieves consensus or not) (ii) accounts for the stochastic nature of these protocols enforcing the equilibrium condition to hold with overwhelming probability (iii) provides a versatile way to describe a wide variety of utility functions that are based on rewards recorded in the ledger and cost incurred during ledger maintenance. We proceed to use our framework to provide a unified picture of incentives in the Bitcoin blockchain, for absolute and relative rewards based utility functions, as well as prove novel results regarding incentives of the Fruitchain blockchain protocol [PODC 2017] showing that the equilibrium condition holds for collusions up to n − 1 players for absolute rewards based utility functions and less than n/2 for relative rewards based utility functions, with the latter result holding for any “weakly fair” blockchain protocol, a new property that we introduce and may be of independent interest."],"paperURL":"https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3479722.3480795","dateUnix":1630447200,"dateEU":"01.09.2021"},"width":null},{"showTitle":false,"category":"paper","type":"dot","style":null,"position":null,"data":{"paperID":74,"title":"Blockchain Technologies: Probability of Double-Spend Attack on a Proof-of-Stake Consensus","url":"https://iohk.io/en/research/library/papers/blockchain-technologies-probability-of-double-spend-attack-on-a-proof-of-stake-consensus/","authors":["Mikolaj Karpinski,","Lyudmila Kovalchuk,","Roman Kochan,","Prof Roman Oliynykov,","Mariia Rodinko,","Lukasz Wieclaw"],"tags":["consensus","proof of stake"],"date":"September 2021","location":"Sensors 2021","desc":["Two double-spend attack strategies on a proof-of-stake consensus are considered.

Among Conclave’s building blocks is a weighted threshold signature scheme (WTSS); to that end, we define a WTSS ideal functionality — which might be of independent interest — and propose two constructions based on threshold ECDSA, which enable (1) fast trustless setup and (2) identifiable aborts."],"paperURL":"https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/742.pdf","dateUnix":1633039200,"dateEU":"01.10.2021"},"width":null},{"showTitle":false,"category":"paper","type":"dot","style":null,"position":null,"data":{"paperID":71,"title":"A Type and Scope Safe Universe of Syntaxes with Binding: Their Semantics and Proofs","url":"https://iohk.io/en/research/library/papers/a-type-and-scope-safe-universe-of-syntaxes-with-binding-their-semantics-and-proofs/","authors":["Guillame Allais,","Robert Atkey,","James Chapman,","Conor McBride,","James McKinna"],"tags":["agda"],"date":"October 2021","location":"Journal of Functional Programming","desc":["The syntax of almost every programming language includes a notion of binder and corresponding bound occurrences, along with the accompanying notions of α-equivalence, capture-avoiding substitution, typing contexts, runtime environments, and so on.

A PCS scheme can be used in a setting where a central authority determines a global policy and distributes public and secret keys associated with sets of attributes to the users in the system. If two users, Alice and Bob, have attribute sets that jointly satisfy the global policy, Alice can use her secret key and Bob's public key to sign a message. Unforgeability ensures that a valid signature can only be produced if Alice's secret key is known and if the policy is satisfied. Privacy guarantees that the public keys and produced signatures reveal nothing about the users' attributes beyond whether they satisfy the policy or not. PCS extends the functionality provided by existing primitives such as attribute-based signatures and policy-based signatures, which do not consider a designated receiver and thus cannot include the receiver's attributes in the policies. We describe practical applications of PCS which include controlling transactions in financial systems with strong privacy guarantees (avoiding additional trusted entities that check compliance), as well as being a tool for trust negotiations.","We introduce an indistinguishability-based privacy notion for PCS and present a generic and modular scheme based on standard building blocks such as signatures, non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs, and a (predicate-only) predicate encryption scheme.

A representative example is the Bitcoin ledger. Indeed, since Bitcoin---and more generally blockchain ledgers---are known to be useful in various scenarios, it has become increasingly popular to capture such ledgers as global setup. Intuitively, one would expect UC to allow us to make security statements about protocols that use such a global setup, e.g., a global ledger, which can then be automatically translated into the setting where the setup is replaced by a protocol implementing it, such as Bitcoin.","We show that the above reasoning is flawed and such a generic security-preserving replacement can only work under very (often unrealistic) strong conditions on the global setup and the security statement.

Its development is supported by several major secure-messaging providers (with a combined user base in the billions) and a growing body of academic research. MLS has evolved over many iterations to become a complex, non-trivial, yet relatively ad-hoc cryptographic protocol. In an effort to tame its complexity and build confidence in its security, past analyses of MLS have restricted themselves to sub-protocols of MLS—most prominently a type of sub-protocol embodying so-called continuous group key agreement (CGKA). However, to date the task of proving or even defining the security of the full MLS protocol has been left open. In this work, we fill in this missing piece. First, we formally capture the security of SGM protocols by defining a corresponding security game, which is parametrized by a safety predicate that characterizes the exact level of security achieved by a construction. Then, we cast MLS as an SGM protocol, showing how to modularly build it from the following three main components (and some additional standard cryptographic primitives) in a black-box fashion: (a) CGKA, (b) forward-secure group AEAD (FS-GAEAD), which is a new primitive and roughly corresponds to an “epoch” of group messaging, and (c) a so-called PRF-PRNG, which is a two-input hash function that is a pseudorandom function (resp. generator with input) in its first (resp. second) input. Crucially, the security predicate for the SGM security of MLS can be expressed purely as a function of the security predicates of the underlying primitives, which allows to swap out any of the components and immediately obtain a security statement for the resulting SGM construction. Furthermore, we provide instantiations of all component primitives, in particular of CGKA with MLS’s TreeKEM sub-protocol (which we prove adaptively secure) and of FS-GAEAD with a novel construction (which has already been adopted by MLS). Along the way we introduce a collection of new techniques, primitives, and results with applications to other SGM protocols and beyond. For example, we extend the Generalized Selective Decryption proof technique (which is central in CGKA literature) and prove adaptive security for another (practical) more secure CGKA protocol called RTreeKEM (Alwen et al., CRYPTO ’20). The modularity of our approach immediately yields a corollary characterizing the security of an SGM construction using RTreeKEM."],"paperURL":"https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/1083.pdf","dateUnix":1635721200,"dateEU":"01.11.2021"},"width":null},{"showTitle":false,"category":"paper","type":"dot","style":null,"position":null,"data":{"paperID":66,"title":"Mining in Logarithmic Space","url":"https://iohk.io/en/research/library/papers/mining-in-logarithmic-space/","authors":["Prof Aggelos Kiayias,","Nikos Leonardos,","Dionysis Zindros"],"tags":["blockchain","light clients"],"date":"November 2021","location":"ACM CCS '21","desc":["Blockchains maintain two types of data: Application data and consensus data.

We present a protocol which allows pruning the blockchain by garbage collecting old blocks as they become unnecessary. These blocks can simply be discarded and are no longer stored by any miner. We show that all miners can be light miners with no harm to security. Our protocol is based on the notion of superblocks, blocks that have achieved an unusually high difficulty. We leverage them to represent underlying proof-of-work without ever illustrating it, storing it, or transmitting it.

The appeal of this notion is that it provides a general template that an application can suitably instantiate by choosing a specific relation. Nonetheless, several important applications have been brought to light, including proofs-of-ownership of files or two-factor authentication, which do not fit the PoK template but naturally appear to be special cases of a more general notion of proofs of knowledge or possession. One would thus expect that their security properties, in particular privacy and soundness, are simply derived as concrete instantiation of a common generalized PoK concept with well understood security semantics. Unfortunately, such a notion does not exist, resulting in a variety of tailor-made security definitions whose plausibility must be checked on a case-by-case basis.","In this work, we close this gap by providing the theoretical foundations of a generalized notion of PoK that encompasses dynamic and setup-dependent relations as well as interactive statement derivations. This novel combination enables an application to directly specify relations that depend on an assumed setup, such as a random oracle, a database or ledger, and to have statements be agreed upon interactively and dynamically between parties based on the state of the setup. Our new notion is called agree-and-prove and provides clear semantics of correctness, soundness, and zero-knowledge in the above generalized scenario.","As an application, we first consider proofs-of-ownership of files for client-side file deduplication.

issue that affects the development of many complex distributed software systems: how to establish quickly, cheaply, and reliably whether they can deliver their intended performance before expending significant time, effort, and money on detailed design and implementation. We describe ΔQSD, a novel metrics-based and quality-centric paradigm that uses formalised outcome diagrams to explore the performance consequences of design decisions, as a performance blueprint of the system. The distinctive feature of outcome diagrams is that they capture the essential observational properties of the system, independent of the details of system structure and behaviour. The ΔQSD paradigm derives bounds on performance expressed as probability distributions encompassing all possible executions of the system. The ΔQSD paradigm is both effective and generic: it allows values from various sources to be combined in a rigorous way so that approximate results can be obtained quickly and subsequently refined. ΔQSD has been successfully used by a small team in Predictable Network Solutions for consultancy on large-scale applications in a number of industries, including telecommunications, avionics, and space and defence, resulting in cumulative savings worth billions of US dollars. The paper outlines the ΔQSD paradigm, describes its formal underpinnings, and illustrates its use via a topical real-world example taken from the blockchain/cryptocurrency domain.

Keller,","Wouter Swierstra"],"tags":["plutus","smartcontract"],"date":"May 2022","location":"FLOPS '22","desc":["Compiler correctness is an old problem, but with the emergence of smart contracts on blockchains that problem presents itself in a new light. Smart contracts are self-contained pieces of software that control assets, which are often of high financial value, in an adversarial environment and, once committed to the blockchain, they cannot be changed anymore. Smart contracts are typically developed in a high-level contract language and compiled to low-level virtual machine code before being committed to the blockchain. For a smart contract user to trust a given piece of low-level code on the blockchain, they must convince themselves that (a) they are in possession of the matching source code and (b) that the compiler faithfully translated the source code's semantics.","Classic approaches to compiler correctness tackle the second point. We argue that translation certification also addresses the first. We describe the proof architecture of a novel translation certification framework, implemented in Coq, for a functional smart contract language. We demonstrate that we can model the compilation pipeline as a sequence of translation relations that facilitate a modular proof approach and are robust in the face of an evolving compiler

A fundamental factor limiting this metric is the propagation latency of blocks through the underlying peer-to-peer network, which is typically constructed by means of random connectivity. Disseminating blocks fast improves not only the transaction throughput, but also the security of the system as it reduces the probability of forks. In this paper we present CougaR: a simple yet efficient, eclipse-resistant, decentralized protocol that substantially reduces the block dissemination time in blockchain networks. CougaR's key advantages stem from its link selection policy, which combines a network latency criterion with randomness to offer fast and reliable block dissemination to the entire network. Moreover, CougaR is eclipse-resistant by design, as nodes are protected from having all their links directly or indirectly imposed on them by others, which is the typical vulnerability exploited to deploy eclipse attacks. We rigorously evaluate CougaR by an extensive set of experiments, both against a wide spectrum of parameter settings, and in comparison to the current state of the art."],"paperURL":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.04911.pdf","dateUnix":1654034400,"dateEU":"01.06.2022"},"width":null},{"showTitle":false,"category":"paper","type":"dot","style":null,"position":null,"data":{"paperID":57,"title":"Babel Fees via Limited Liabilities","url":"https://iohk.io/en/research/library/papers/babel-fees-via-limited-liabilities/","authors":["Manuel Chakravarty,","Nikos Karayannidis,","Prof Aggelos Kiayias,","Michael Peyton Jones,","Polina Vinogradova"],"tags":["transaction fees"],"date":"June 2022","location":"ACNS '22","desc":["Custom currencies (ERC-20) on Ethereum are wildly popular, but they are second class to the primary currency Ether.

Specifically, supporting assets of multiple types and providing a mechanism to atomically exchange them, which is critical for e.g. decentralized finance (DeFi), is challenging in the private setting. By combining insights and security properties from Zcash and SwapCT (PETS 21, an atomic swap system for Monero), we present a simple zk-SNARKs-based transaction scheme, called Zswap, which is carefully malleable to allow the merging of transactions, while preserving anonymity. Our protocol enables multiple assets and atomic exchanges by making use of sparse homomorphic commitments with aggregated open randomness, together with Zcash-friendly simulation-extractable non-interactive zero-knowledge (NIZK) proofs. This results in a provably secure privacy-preserving transaction protocol, with efficient swaps, and overall performance close to that of existing deployed private cryptocurrencies.

(ACNS'21) introduced Sleeve, which describes an extra security layer for signature schemes, i.e., ECDSA. This distinctive feature is a new key generation mechanism, allowing users to generate a ''back up key'' securely nested inside the secret key of a signature scheme.","Using this novel construction, the ''back up key'', which is secret, can be used to generate a ''proof of ownership'', i.e., only the rightful owner of this secret key can generate such a proof.  This design offers a quantum secure fallback, i.e., a brand new quantum resistant signature, ready to be used, nested in the ECDSA secret key.

This paper studies in particular PRNGs that are secure against premature next attacks (Kelsey et al., FSE '98), a class of attacks leveraging the fact that a PRNG may produce an output (which could be seen by an adversary!) before enough entropy has been accumulated. Practical designs adopt either unsound entropy-estimation methods to prevent such attacks (as in Linux's /dev/random) or sophisticated pool-based approaches as in Yarrow (MacOS/FreeBSD) and Fortuna (Windows).","The only prior theoretical study of premature next attacks (Dodis et al., Algorithmica '17) considers either a seeded setting or assumes a constant entropy rate, and thus falls short of providing and validating practical designs. Assuming the availability of random seed is particularly problematic, first because this requires us to somehow generate a random seed without using our PRNG, but also because we must ensure that the entropy inputs to the PRNG remain independent of the seed. Indeed, all practical designs are seedless. However, prior works on seedless PRNGs (Coretti et al., CRYPTO '19; Dodis et al., ITC '21, CRYPTO'21) do not consider premature next attacks.","The main goal of this paper is to investigate the feasibility of theoretically sound seedless PRNGs that are secure against premature next attacks. To this end, we make the following contributions:","1. We prove that it is impossible to achieve seedless PRNGs that are secure against premature-next attacks, even in a rather weak model. Namely, the impossibility holds even when the entropic inputs to the PRNG are independent. In particular, our impossibility result holds in settings where seedless PRNGs are otherwise possible.","2. Given the above impossibility result, we investigate whether existing seedless pool-based approaches meant to overcome premature next attacks in practical designs provide meaningful guarantees in certain settings. Specifically, we show the following.","* We introduce a natural condition on the entropic input and prove that it implies security of the round-robin entropy accumulation PRNG used by Windows 10, called Fortuna. Intuitively, our condition requires the input entropy \"not to vary too wildly\" within a given round-robin round.","* We prove that the \"root pool\" approach (also used in Windows 10) is secure for general entropy inputs, provided that the system's state is not compromised after system startup."],"paperURL":"https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/558.pdf","dateUnix":1656626400,"dateEU":"01.07.2022"},"width":null},{"showTitle":false,"category":"paper","type":"dot","style":null,"position":null,"data":{"paperID":51,"title":"Interhead Hydra: Two Heads are Better than One","url":"https://iohk.io/en/research/library/papers/interhead-hydra-two-heads-are-better-than-one/","authors":["Maxim Jourenko,","Mario Larangeira,","Keisuke Tanaka"],"tags":["cardano","layer two","micropayment","payment channels"],"date":"July 2022","location":"Marble '22","desc":["Distributed ledger are maintained through consensus protocols executed by mutually distrustful parties. However, these consensus protocols have inherent limitations thus resulting in scalability issues of the ledger. Layer-2 protocols operate on channels and allow parties to interact with another without going through the consensus protocol albeit relying on its security as fall-back. Prominent Layer-2 protocols are payment channels for Bitcoin that allow two parties to exchange coins, State Channels for Ethereum that allow two parties to execute a state machine, and Hydra heads [FC’21] for Cardano which allows multiple parties execution of Constraint Emitting Machines (CEM). Channels can be concatenated into networks using techniques such as Hashed Timelocked Contracts to execute payments or virtual state channels as introduced by Dziembowski et al. [CCS’18] to execute state machines. These constructions allow interaction between two parties across a channel network, i.e. the two endpoints of a path of channels. This is realized by utilizing intermediaries, which are the parties on the channel path which are in-between both endpoints, who have to pay collateral to ensure security of the constructions. While these approaches can be used with Hydra, they cannot be trivially extended to allow execution of CEMs between an arbitrary amount of parties across different Hydra heads. This work addresses this gap by introducing the Interhead construction that allows for the iterative creation of virtual Hydra heads. Of independent interest, our construction is the first that (1) supports channels with an arbitrary amount of parties and (2) allows for collateral to be paid by multiple intermediaries which allows to share this burden and thus improves practicality."],"paperURL":"https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/1188","dateUnix":1656626400,"dateEU":"01.07.2022"},"width":null},{"showTitle":false,"category":"paper","type":"dot","style":null,"position":null,"data":{"paperID":52,"title":"Bottom-up Trust Registry in Self Sovereign Identity","url":"https://iohk.io/en/research/library/papers/bottom-up-trust-registry-in-self-sovereign-identity/","authors":["Kai Jun Eer,","Jesus Diaz,","Markulf Kohlweiss"],"tags":[],"date":"July 2022","location":"BLOCKCHAIN '22","desc":["Self sovereign identity is a form of decentralised credential management.

In a nutshell, after performing an initial setup in which the hot wallet receives partial information of the cold wallet in order to hierarchically generate (transaction receiving) addresses, the cold wallet stays offline, whereas the hot wallet is kept online. The initial transferred information enables the hot wallet to generate receiving addresses for both wallets, but it can only spend its own funds, i.e., it cannot spend the funds in the cold wallet. This design conveniently mimics money storage in daily life: pocket money is kept in a less safe location, e.g., a regular wallet, while life savings are kept in a more safe environment, e.g., banking account. Note that the funds that land in offline addresses cannot be spent if the cold wallet is kept permanently offline. We propose a protocol and a technical solution to spend funds from a cold wallet without physically connecting it to any network. We designed and implemented a prototype for a system based on Optical Camera Communication (OCC) in a screen to camera setting, which can receive messages from a computer screen at the rate of over 150kB per second. Our system consists of a sequence of QR codes – a QR video. Our solution minimizes the possible attack vectors, including malware, by relying on optical communication yet providing a larger bandwidth than regular QR code based

These events, and numerous others, underscore the importance of Blockchain governance, namely the set of processes that blockchain platforms utilize in order to perform decision-making and converge to a widely accepted direction for the system to evolve. While a rich topic of study in other areas, governance of blockchain platforms is lacking a well established set of methods and practices that are adopted industry wide. This makes the topic of blockchain governance a fertile domain for a thorough systematization that we undertake in this work.","We start by distilling a comprehensive array of properties for sound governance systems drawn from academic sources as well as grey literature of election systems and blockchain white papers. These are divided into seven categories, confidentiality, verifiability, accountability, sustainability, Pareto efficiency, suffrage and liveness that capture the whole spectrum of desiderata of governance systems. We proceed to classify ten well-documented blockchain systems. While all properties are satisfied, even partially, by at least one system, no system that satisfies most of them. Our work lays out a foundation for assessing blockchain governance processes.

Armed with this model, we evaluate the compliance of various Proof-of-Work (PoW) and Proof-of-Stake (PoS) protocol families, with respect to different utility functions and reward schemes, leading to the following results: i) PoS ledgers under resource-proportional rewards can be compliant if costs are negligible, but non-compliant if costs are significant; ii) PoW and PoS under block-proportional rewards exhibit different compliance behavior, depending on the lossiness of the network; iii) PoS ledgers can be compliant w.r.t. one infraction, i.e., producing conflicting messages, but non-compliant (and non-equilibria) w.r.t. abstaining or an attack we call selfish signing; iv) taking externalities, such as exchange rate fluctuations, into account, we quantify the benefit of economic penalties, in the context of PoS protocols, in disincentivizing particular infractions."],"paperURL":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.00858.pdf","dateUnix":1661983200,"dateEU":"01.09.2022"},"width":null},{"showTitle":false,"category":"paper","type":"dot","style":null,"position":null,"data":{"paperID":44,"title":"A Game-Theoretic Analysis of Delegation Incentives in Blockchain Governance","url":"https://iohk.io/en/research/library/papers/a-game-theoretic-analysis-of-delegation-incentives-in-blockchain-governance/","authors":["Lyudmila Kovalchuk,","Mariia Rodinko,","Prof Roman Oliynykov"],"tags":["governance","incentives"],"date":"September 2022","location":"CBT '22","desc":["The paper presents a mathematical description of the vote delegation incentive process for funding proposals in a decentralized governance system using a blockchain-based voting.

Our updatable ideal functionality framework provides a general template for expressing the security we expect from cryptographic agility capturing in a fine-grained manner all the properties that can be retained across implementation updates. We exemplify our framework over two basic cryptographic primitives, digital signatures and non-interactive zero-knowledge (NIZK), where we demonstrate how to achieve updateability with consistency and backwards-compatibility across updates in a composable manner.

Unfortunately, the real-world implementations of peer-to-peer gossip-style networks used by blockchain protocols rely on a number of ad-hoc attack mitigation strategies that leave a glaring gap between the idealized communication layer assumed in formal security arguments for blockchains and the real world, where a wide array of attacks have been showcased.","In this work we bridge this gap by presenting a Byzantine-resilient network layer for blockchain protocols.

Its exact semantics nevertheless remain highly contested and ambiguous, with proponents and critics disagreeing widely on the level of decentralization offered. To address this, we put forth a systematization of the current landscape with respect to decentralization and we derive a methodology that can help direct future research towards defining and measuring decentralization. Our approach dissects blockchain systems into multiple layers, or strata, each possibly encapsulating multiple categories, and enables a unified method for measuring decentralization in each one. Our layers are (1) hardware, (2) software, (3) network, (4) consensus, (5) economics (\"tokenomics\"), (6) API, (7) governance, and (8) geography.

Our work highlights the challenges in measuring and achieving decentralization, points to the degree of (de)centralization of various existing systems, where such assessment can be made from presently available public information, and suggests potential metrics and directions where future research is needed.

This gap is most noticable for blockchains that are parametrized to maximize throughput by selecting block-creation time commesurate with network delays.","In this work we provide a new approach for obtaining such settlement-time guarantees. Our results give a rigorous framework for analyzing consistency that yields an efficient computational method for computing explicit bounds on settlement time as a function of honest and adversarial computational power and a bound on network delays. Our framework simultaneously provides upper and lower bounds on settlement times, which permits an immediate evaluation of the strength of the bounds.

This setting provides a better situation than a simple assumption of honest majority, since it involves stake in a decentralized ledger, and the public verifiability of the reputation score via verification of the stake distribution."],"paperURL":"https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/1165.pdf","dateUnix":1669849200,"dateEU":"01.12.2022"},"width":null},{"showTitle":false,"category":"paper","type":"dot","style":null,"position":null,"data":{"paperID":19,"title":"Probability of double spend attack for network with non-zero time delay","url":"https://iohk.io/en/research/library/papers/probability-of-double-spend-attack-for-network-with-non-zero-time-delay/","authors":["Lyudmila Kovalchuk,","Mariia Rodinko,","Prof Roman Oliynykov,","Dmytro Kaidalov,","Andrii Nastenko"],"tags":["proof of work"],"date":"December 2022","desc":["The paper presents the formulas for probability of a double spend attack on blockchain with Proof-of-Work consensus protocol for a network with a non-zero synchronization time.

In this paper, we consider the notion of ε-well-supported Nash equilibrium, where ε ∈ [0, 1] corresponds to the approximation guarantee. Put simply, in an ε-well-supported equilibrium, every player chooses with positive probability actions that are within ε of the maximum achievable payoff, against the other player’s strategy. Ever since the initial approximation guarantee of 2/3 for well-supported equilibria, which was established more than a decade ago, the progress on this problem has been extremely slow and incremental. Notably, the small improvements to 0.6608, and finally to 0.6528, were achieved by algorithms of growing complexity. Our main result is a simple and intuitive algorithm, that improves the approximation guarantee to 1/2. Our algorithm is based on linear programming and in particular on exploiting suitably defined zero-sum games that arise from the payoff matrices of the two players. As a byproduct, we show how to achieve the same approximation guarantee in a query-efficient

the most promising scalability and extended functionality solutions for blockchains. Application of zero knowledge techniques (Latus, Mina) allows for reaching high level security and general throughput, though it brings new challenges on keeping decentralization where significant effort is required for robust computation of zk-proofs. We consider a simultaneous decentralized creation of various zk-proof trees that form proof-trees sequences in sidechains in the model that combines behavior of provers, both deterministic (mutually consistent) or stochastic (independent) and types of proof trees. We define the concept of efficiency of such process, introduce its quantity measure and recommend parameters for tree creation. In deterministic cases, the sequences of published trees are ultimately periodic and ensure the highest possible efficiency (no collisions in proof creation). In stochastic cases, we obtain a universal measure of prover efficiencies given by the explicit formula in one case or calculated by a simulation model in another case. The optimal number of allowed provers’ positions for a step can be set for various sidechain parameters, such as number of provers, number of time steps within one block, etc. Benefits and restrictions for utilization of non-perfect binary proof trees are also explicitly

for a variety of decentralized applications (DApps) that can serve different purposes and have different urgency requirements. Despite this, the transaction fee mechanisms currently deployed in popular platforms as well as previous modeling attempts for the associated mechanism design problem focus on an approach that favors increasing prices in favor of those clients who value immediate service during periods of congestion. To address this issue, we introduce a model that captures the traffic diversity of blockchain systems and a tiered pricing mechanism that is capable of implementing more inclusive transaction policies. In this model, we demonstrate formally that EIP-1559, the transaction fee mechanism currently used in Ethereum, is not inclusive and demonstrate experimentally that its prices surge horizontally during periods of congestion. On the other hand, we prove formally that our mechanism achieves stable prices in expectation and we provide experimental results that establish that prices for transactions can be kept low for low urgency transactions, resulting in a diverse set of transaction types entering the blockchain. At the same time, perhaps surprisingly, our mechanism does not necessarily sacrifice revenue since the lowering of the prices for low urgency transactions can be covered from high urgency ones due to the price discrimination ability of the mechanism."],"paperURL":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.06014.pdf","dateUnix":1680300000,"dateEU":"01.04.2023"},"width":null},{"showTitle":false,"category":"paper","type":"dot","style":null,"position":null,"data":{"paperID":11,"title":"Privacy-Preserving Blueprints","url":"https://iohk.io/en/research/library/papers/privacy-preserving-blueprints/","authors":["Markulf Kohlweiss,","Anna Lysyanskaya,","An Nguyen"],"tags":["privacy"],"date":"April 2023","location":"Eurocrypt '23","desc":["In a world where everyone uses anonymous credentials for all access control needs, it is impossible to trace wrongdoers, by design.  This makes legitimate controls, such as tracing illicit trade and terror suspects, impossible to carry out.  Here, we propose a privacy-preserving blueprint capability that allows an auditor to publish an encoding of the function f(x, ·) for a publicly known function f and a secret input x. For example, x may be a secret watchlist, and f(x, y) may return y if y ∈ x.

ecosystems have formed to provide financial services and other utility. This results in an ever increasing demand for transactions on blockchains, however, the amount of transactions per second on a given ledger is limited. Layer-2 systems attempt to improve scalability by taking transactions off-chain, with building blocks that are two party channels which are concatenated to form networks. Interaction between two parties requires (1) routing such a network, (2) interaction with and collateral from all intermediaries on the routed path and (3) interactions are often more limited compared to what can be done on the ledger. In contrast to that design, recent constructions such as Hydra Heads (FC’21) are both multi-party and isomorphic, allowing interactions to have the same expressiveness as on the ledger making it akin to a ledger located on Layer-2. The follow up Interhead Construction (MARBLE’22) further extends the protocol to connect Hydra Heads into networks by means of a “virtual” Hydra Head construction. This work puts forth an even greater generalization of the Interhead Protocol, allowing for interaction across different Layer-2 ledgers with a multitude of improvements. As concrete example, our design is modular and lightweight, which makes it viable for both full virtual ledger constructions as well as straightforward one-time interactions and payments systems."],"paperURL":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/478201/items/TX6D4ARC/file/view?key=PnpP8O1NApZMMF0LVNh7I4I5","dateUnix":1682892000,"dateEU":"01.05.2023"},"width":null},{"showTitle":false,"category":"paper","type":"dot","style":null,"position":null,"data":{"paperID":8,"title":"Improved EFX Approximation Guarantees under Ordinal-based Assumptions","url":"https://iohk.io/en/research/library/papers/improved-efx-approximation-guarantees-under-ordinal-based-assumptions/","authors":["Evangelos Markakis,","Christodoulos Santorinaios"],"tags":[],"date":"May 2023","location":"AAMAS '23","desc":["Our work studies the fair allocation of indivisible items to a set of agents, and falls within the scope of establishing improved approximation guarantees. It is well known by now that the classic solution concepts in fair division, such as envy-freeness and proportionality, fail to exist in the presence of indivisible items. Unfortunately, the lack of existence remains unresolved even for some relaxations of envy-freeness, and most notably for the notion of EFX, which has attracted significant attention in the relevant literature. This in turn has motivated the quest for approximation algorithms, resulting in the currently best known (𝜙 − 1)-approximation guarantee by [5], where 𝜙 equals the golden ratio. So far, it has been notoriously hard to obtain any further advancements beyond this factor. Our main contribution is that we achieve better approximations, for certain special cases, where the agents agree on their perception of some items in terms of their worth. In particular, we first provide an algorithm with a 2/3-approximation, when the agents agree on what are the top 𝑛 items (but not necessarily on their exact ranking), with 𝑛 being the number of agents. To do so, we also propose a general framework that can be of independent interest for obtaining further guarantees. Secondly, we establish the existence of exact EFX allocations in a different scenario, where the agents view the items as split into tiers w.r.t. their value, and they agree on which items belong to each tier. Overall, our results provide evidence that improved guarantees can still be possible by exploiting ordinal information of the valuations."],"paperURL":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/478201/items/BG2Q8YUW/file/view?key=PnpP8O1NApZMMF0LVNh7I4I5","dateUnix":1682892000,"dateEU":"01.05.2023"},"width":null},{"showTitle":false,"category":"paper","type":"dot","style":null,"position":null,"data":{"paperID":9,"title":"Djed: A Formally Verified Crypto-Backed Pegged Algorithmic Stablecoin","url":"https://iohk.io/en/research/library/papers/djed-a-formally-verified-crypto-backed-pegged-algorithmic-stablecoin/","authors":["Joachim Zahnentferner,","Dmytro Kaidalov,","Jean-Frédéric Etienne,","Javier Roberto Diaz"],"tags":[],"date":"May 2023","location":"CBC '23","desc":["This paper describes Djed, an algorithmic stablecoin protocol that behaves like an autonomous bank that buys and sells stablecoins for a price in a range that is pegged to a target price.

And revenue from sales of stablecoins to users are stored in the reserve. Besides stablecoins, the bank also trades reservecoins in order to capitalize itself and maintain a reserve ratio significantly greater than one. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first stablecoin protocol where stability claims are precisely and mathematically stated and proven.

Timeliness, i.e., delivering results within the required time bounds, makes a major contribution to the predictability of performance. In this paper, we focus on timeliness using the ΔQ Systems Development paradigm (ΔQSD, developed by PNSol), which computes timeliness by modelling systems observationally using so-called outcome expressions. An outcome expression is a compositional definition of a system’s observed behaviour in terms of its basic operations. Given the stochastic behaviour of the basic operations, ΔQSD efficiently computes the stochastic behaviour of the whole system including its timeliness.","This paper formally proves useful algebraic properties of outcome expressions w.r.t. timeliness: We prove the different algebraic structures the set of outcome expressions form with the different ΔQSD operators and demonstrate why those operators do not form richer structures. We prove or disprove the set of all possible distributivity results on outcome expressions. We prove 14 equivalences that have been used in the past in the practice of ΔQSD.","An immediate benefit is rewrite rules that can be used for design exploration under established timeliness equivalence. This work is part of an ongoing project to disseminate and build tool support for ΔQSD. The ability to rewrite outcome expressions is essential for efficient tool support."],"paperURL":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/478201/items/JQEX4BMN/file/view?key=PnpP8O1NApZMMF0LVNh7I4I5","dateUnix":1685570400,"dateEU":"01.06.2023"},"width":null},{"showTitle":false,"category":"paper","type":"dot","style":null,"position":null,"data":{"paperID":6,"title":"A Decentralized Information Marketplace Preserving Input and Output Privacy","url":"https://iohk.io/en/research/library/papers/a-decentralized-information-marketplace-preserving-input-and-output-privacy/","authors":["Steven Golob,","Sikha Pentyala,","Rafael Dowsley,","Bernardo David,","Mario Larangeira,","Martine De Cock,","Anderson Nascimento"],"tags":[],"date":"June 2023","location":"DEC '23","desc":["Data-driven applications are engines of economic growth and essential for progress in many domains.

card networks with respect to the transactions per second rate. This seems to be an unfair comparison  since these networks do not complete a transaction from beginning to end. Rather they buy the risk and settle it much later. Typically transactions have only two players, the payer and the payee, and the settlement of this transaction requires time since it depends on basic properties of the consensus protocol. In practice, the payee, very often, needs to wait  for confirmation in order to ship the traded goods. Alternatively, the payee, or merchant, can ship it in faith that the transaction will be confirmed. Our contribution, the Maravedí Protocol,  introduces a third player to minimize the risk of the payee to be left without the payment even without the consensus layer confirmation. The main idea is that the third player can work similarly to a credit card company. That is, it buys the risk from the merchant, by a small discount, and allows the third player to pay it instantaneously via a payment-channel like protocol. In parallel, the third player receives the regular payment transaction from the payer that can be settled on the chain, thus, after waiting the consensus/blockchain required time. Moreover, the on-chain transaction pays the full amount, allowing the third player to cash in the discount. Hence on the side of the merchant, our protocol puts forth instantaneous finality in a novel way to the best of our knowledge."],"paperURL":"https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/183.pdf","dateUnix":1688162400,"dateEU":"01.07.2023","position":"70perc","showTitle":true},"width":null}],"tvlUSD":159130922.93696767,"tvlADA":554849801.0354521,"position":"70perc","singleContain":"paper"},{"dateEU":"02.07.2023","dateUnix":1688256000,"priceUSD":0.2921,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":162183910.7527044,"tvlADA":555234203.1930996},{"dateEU":"03.07.2023","dateUnix":1688342400,"priceUSD":0.2916,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":162620323.11519074,"tvlADA":557682863.9066898},{"dateEU":"04.07.2023","dateUnix":1688428800,"priceUSD":0.2957,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":165808753.61773944,"tvlADA":560733018.6599237},{"dateEU":"05.07.2023","dateUnix":1688515200,"priceUSD":0.2929,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":164773333.87307855,"tvlADA":562558326.6407598},{"dateEU":"06.07.2023","dateUnix":1688601600,"priceUSD":0.2842,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":161873745.09847254,"tvlADA":569576865.2303748},{"dateEU":"07.07.2023","dateUnix":1688688000,"priceUSD":0.28,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":161067625.7394784,"tvlADA":575241520.4981371},{"dateEU":"08.07.2023","dateUnix":1688774400,"priceUSD":0.2842,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":164775581.70421588,"tvlADA":579787409.2336942},{"dateEU":"09.07.2023","dateUnix":1688860800,"priceUSD":0.2906,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":168469410.25464815,"tvlADA":579729560.4082868},{"dateEU":"10.07.2023","dateUnix":1688947200,"priceUSD":0.2845,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":163385190.18418223,"tvlADA":574288893.4417653},{"dateEU":"11.07.2023","dateUnix":1689033600,"priceUSD":0.2877,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":166876972.12430838,"tvlADA":580038137.3802863},{"dateEU":"12.07.2023","dateUnix":1689120000,"priceUSD":0.2927,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":170482815.8165583,"tvlADA":582448977.849533},{"dateEU":"13.07.2023","dateUnix":1689206400,"priceUSD":0.2887,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":166719060.98632246,"tvlADA":577482026.2775284},{"dateEU":"14.07.2023","dateUnix":1689292800,"priceUSD":0.3569,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":209155719.59694862,"tvlADA":586034518.34393},{"dateEU":"15.07.2023","dateUnix":1689379200,"priceUSD":0.3287,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":187208646.37144282,"tvlADA":569542580.9900907},{"dateEU":"16.07.2023","dateUnix":1689465600,"priceUSD":0.3259,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":188358328.318331,"tvlADA":577963572.6245197},{"dateEU":"17.07.2023","dateUnix":1689552000,"priceUSD":0.3147,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":182995475.68857113,"tvlADA":581491819.7920914},{"dateEU":"18.07.2023","dateUnix":1689638400,"priceUSD":0.3126,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":183270008.03711036,"tvlADA":586276417.2652283},{"dateEU":"19.07.2023","dateUnix":1689724800,"priceUSD":0.3069,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":183449061.70630538,"tvlADA":597748653.3278116},{"dateEU":"20.07.2023","dateUnix":1689811200,"priceUSD":0.3241,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":190830528.69584844,"tvlADA":588801384.4364345},{"dateEU":"21.07.2023","dateUnix":1689897600,"priceUSD":0.3158,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":185394242.73367566,"tvlADA":587062199.9166423},{"dateEU":"22.07.2023","dateUnix":1689984000,"priceUSD":0.3132,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":186103920.70299283,"tvlADA":594201534.8115991},{"dateEU":"23.07.2023","dateUnix":1690070400,"priceUSD":0.3082,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":180609257.90386346,"tvlADA":586013166.4628925},{"dateEU":"24.07.2023","dateUnix":1690156800,"priceUSD":0.317,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":186277337.65140483,"tvlADA":587625670.8246208},{"dateEU":"25.07.2023","dateUnix":1690243200,"priceUSD":0.3053,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":178038014.9239372,"tvlADA":583157598.8337281},{"dateEU":"26.07.2023","dateUnix":1690329600,"priceUSD":0.3039,"markers":[{"category":"node-release","type":"node","data":{"name":"Cardano

proof-of-work (PoW), aims to re-purpose the network’s computing power. Namely, users evaluate meaningful computational problems, e.g., solving optimization problems, instead of computing numerous hash function values as in PoW. A recent approach utilizes the training process of deep learning as “useful work”. However, these works lack security analysis when deploying them with blockchain-based protocols, let alone the informal and over-complicated system design. This work proposes a distributed proof-of-deep-learning (D-PoDL) scheme concerning PoUW’s requirements. With a novel hash-traininßg-hash structure and model-referencing mechanism, our scheme is the first deep learningbased PoUW scheme that enables achieving better accuracy distributively. Next, we introduce a transformation from the D-PoDL scheme to a generic D-PoDL blockchain protocol which can be instantiated with two chain selection rules, i.e., the longest-chain rule and the weight-based blockchain framework (LatinCrypt’ 21). This work is the first to provide formal proofs for deep learning-involved blockchain protocols concerning the robust ledger properties, i.e., chain growth, chain quality, and common prefix.

Our techniques apply with some adaptations also to the proof-of-work setting where they provide improvements to the state-of-the-art settlement bounds for proof-of-work protocols."],"paperURL":"https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/1571.pdf","dateUnix":1690840800,"dateEU":"01.08.2023"},"width":null}],"tvlUSD":184203872.08664528,"tvlADA":599426853.5198349},{"dateEU":"02.08.2023","dateUnix":1690934400,"priceUSD":0.3094,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":186299960.88371092,"tvlADA":602133034.5304166},{"dateEU":"03.08.2023","dateUnix":1691020800,"priceUSD":0.299,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":179403448.43825328,"tvlADA":600011533.2383053},{"dateEU":"04.08.2023","dateUnix":1691107200,"priceUSD":0.2924,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":175685744.98687428,"tvlADA":600840441.131581},{"dateEU":"05.08.2023","dateUnix":1691193600,"priceUSD":0.2935,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":174976635.6463722,"tvlADA":596172523.4970093},{"dateEU":"05.08.2023","dateUnix":1691257024,"priceUSD":0.2918,"markers":[],"tvlUSD":174976635.6463722,"tvlADA":599645769.8641953}]
